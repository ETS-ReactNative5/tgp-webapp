On top of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/16/upshot/costs-health-care-us.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">high administrative costs</a>, costly deductibles, and payments for procedures, most uninsured people are low-income and disproportionally people of color.</p><p>The Affordable Care Act (ACA) made history by expanding health insurance to 30 million Americans by requiring people to buy private health insurance policies and expanding Medicaid. However, it left private insurance companies in charge of our healthcare system. Their ability to consolidate power in order to command market prices continues to drive up costs. So, while people may have more "access" to healthcare, the legal requirement to buy into private health insurance left many with high premiums, and a heavy burden of debt.</p><p>Basic human rights, like our healthcare, should not be privatized into a 100 billion dollar industry, PERIOD.</p><p><strong>The Profit Motive</strong></p><p>Once we are able to eliminate private insurers from the equation, their ability to drive up prices for premiums, deductibles, and admin costs will, in effect, also be eliminated. That's more money in your pocket. The only ones who lose are private insurance executives and shareholders. On top of that, the for-profit private health insurance companies <a href="https://www.vox.com/a/health-prices" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have proven ineffective when it comes to negotiating</a> with for prescription drugs and other forms of medicine. A Medicare for All "Single Payer" System will provide universal health insurance which will eliminate out-of-pocket expenses, the aforementioned costs of the private health insurance bureaucracy, and be able to negotiate for affordable prescription drugs.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What Is Single Payer Healthcare?</strong></p><p>The United States is the only country in the developed world that does not guarantee access to basic health care for residents. Countries that guarantee health care as a human right do so through a “single-payer” system, which replaces the thousands of for-profit health insurance companies with a public, universal plan.</p><p><br></p><p>If you think this is politically unfeasible to win in the United States, take a look <a href="https://pnhp.org/news/two-thirds-of-voters-support-providing-medicare-to-every-american/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at the across-the-board support</a> for the program. Afraid it can't work? It already exists for seniors! Medicare is a public, universal plan that provides basic health coverage to those age 65 and older. Medicare costs less than private health insurance, provides better financial security, and is <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/186527/americans-government-health-plans-satisfied.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">preferred by most patients</a>. Single-payer is often described as “Expanded & Improved Medicare for All.”</p><p><br></p><p>A single-payer system would <a href="https://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/healthcare/484301-22-studies-agree-medicare-for-all-saves-money" target="_blank" rel="noopener">save at least $2 trillion in net savings over the course of ten years</a>, which is now wasted on administrative overhead and monopoly profits. </p><p><br></p><p>And, finally, the $2 trillion-dollar question: How do we pay for it? For starters, we can increase personal income taxes on the top 5% of income earners, an additional 2% tax on those who make more than $250,000 (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/28/opinion/campaign-stops/250000-a-year-is-not-middle-class.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less than 3% of the population</a>) in taxable income, and a 6% premium on large, billion-dollar corporations. The rest of the necessary funding will be through the authorization of funds via the Federal Reserve. Aside from the savings we would accrue over time as a whole (as previously stated), small-to-medium sized employers, as well as labor unions, will be relieved from the burden of negotiating healthcare services for employees, as they will already be covered.</p><p>As a first step in congress, we will support and co-sponsor H.R. 1384 - "Medicare For All Act" which will provide comprehensive healthcare coverage including at least the following:</p><p><br><br></p><ul><li>Primary care and prevention</li><li>Approved dietary and nutritional therapies</li><li>Inpatient care</li><li>Outpatient care</li><li>Emergency care</li><li>Prescription drugs</li><li>Durable medical equipment</li><li>Long-term care</li><li>Palliative care</li><li>Mental health services</li><li>The full scope of dental services, services, including periodontics, oral surgery, and dental (not including cosmetic dentistry)</li><li>Substance abuse treatment services</li><li>Chiropractic services, not including electrical stimulation</li><li>Basic vision care and vision correction (other than laser vision correction for cosmetic purposes)</li><li>Hearing services, including coverage of hearing aids</li><li>Podiatry care</li></ul><p><strong>Control Prescription Drug Pricing</strong></p><p>We need to control the monopolizing of profits by the big pharmaceutical companies by regulating the prices they charge for prescription drugs. On top of creating an government apparatus that can negotiate for better prices, we need to pass a bill that will allow us to purchase prescription drugs from other countries that are providing the same drugs by the same reputable companies from countries like Canada. In 2017, <a href="https://theintercept.com/2017/01/12/cory-booker-joins-senate-republicans-to-kill-measure-to-import-cheaper-medicine-from-canada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">13 Democratic Senators voted NO on an amendment</a> that would lower prescription drugs by importing them from Canada.</p><p>We need to pass legislation like the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/2023/text#:~:text=Introduced%20in%20Senate%20(09%2F10%2F2015)&text=To%20ensure%20greater%20affordability%20of%20prescription%20drugs.&text=To%20ensure%20greater%20affordability%20of%20prescription%20drugs.,-Be%20it%20enacted&text=%E2%80%94This%20Act%20may%20be%20cited,Drug%20Affordability%20Act%20of%202015%E2%80%9D." target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prescription Drug Affordability Act of 2015</a> that would allow the importation by individuals of prescription drugs from Canada and other countries. We need to establish restrictions on certain anti-competitive patent settlements known as "pay-for-delay" agreements which effectively block generic drug competition, and we must allow the Federal Trade Commission to initiate proceedings to enforce these restrictions. Lastly, we will fight to require drug manufacturers to provide rebates for drugs dispensed to low-income individuals. </p><h4><strong>Jobs and a Green New Deal</strong></h4><p><strong>A visionary Economy</strong></p><p>WE are running on a visionary platform. Angelica, with the help of the people of CA29, will work in Congress to push for a 21st Century Economy where we lift people out of poverty, grow the middle class, make the ultra-wealthy billionaire class pay their fair share, all while protecting our environment. It's an economic policy that puts the quality of life for workers and their families first.<br></p><p>In the 21st Century each and every one of us should have a job that pays a living wage, where you can work 30 hours a week, not flounder in poverty, and spend more quality time with friends and family. These will be jobs that preserve our environment, invest in the expansion of public transportation, and rebuild our crumbling infrastructure.</p><p>Our number-one priority in the labor market will be the preservation and restoration of our environment, and a speedy transition from our reliance on fossil fuels and natural gas to 100% clean renewable energy by 2030. The culture of labor must also be rethought, where idea creation and community building will be rewarded and encouraged. The existence of the ultra-wealthy will be dismantled, the top 1% will pay their fair share,  and corporations and wealthy individuals will not avoid <a href="https://www.occrp.org/en/panamapapers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">paying their taxes by stashing their money overseas</a>. We happen to be the wealthiest nation on Earth, so if other countries can implement the change the world requires, we can too.</p><p><strong>Job Guarantee Program</strong></p><p>To achieve the goals of increasing GDP and full employment, we require a Federal Jobs Guarantee Program. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the national unemployment rate was around 5%, while the unemployment rate for California’s 29th Congressional District was around 6.5%. Now, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/09/the-us-is-officially-in-a-recession-will-it-become-a-depression.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our national unemployment rate rests around 13%</a>, and it could very well get worse. But it doesn't have to. If this pandemic has proven anything, it's that our government can spend virtually unlimited amounts of money if it wants to, <a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/03/27/coronavirus-stimulus-package-spending/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as seen through The CARES Act</a>. Our Government absolutely has the ability to provide secure jobs at a livable wage rate. Not only does it have the ability, but it has the imperative for reasons of public health, national skills capacity, future crisis preparedness, <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/05/covid-19-recession-new-deal-plan.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and many other reasons of state</a>.</p><p><strong>Equal Pay</strong><br>WE will sponsor legislation to ensure that there is equal pay regardless of gender, race, or age. If people are working the same position with the same amount of skill and job experience, then they should be paid the same as their counterparts.</p><p><strong>Guaranteed Basic Income</strong></p><p>While we envision a more just economy, our present reality shows wealth and income inequality in an upward trajectory, jobs are disappearing, and automation of human labor advances. Providing a universal guaranteed income to cover any living costs a person may need while we brave this hasty transition of energy, and economic structure, will be a bare-minimum necessity.</p><p><a href="https://issuu.com/sunrisemvmt/docs/gndres/8" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Green New Deal</strong></a><br>WE must move towards 100% clean renewable energy by 2030, PERIOD. Our reliance on fossil fuels and natural gas have moved us to the edge of extinction, <a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/faq/16/is-it-too-late-to-prevent-climate-change/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no hyperbole</a>. The debate has long been over. We know that fossil fuels, and other burned gasses, rises into the atmosphere where it gets trapped, thus creating a "green-house effect," which warms up the planet. We know that this global warming creates a vicious cycle; extreme droughts, rising oceans, and collapsing ecosystems all paint a picture of unimaginable suffering, which we are now only beginning to experience. Climate disruption is a human-made disaster, and a Green New Deal is the necessary start to warding off the worst effects of it. The <a href="https://newconsensus.com/green-new-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">details</a> and <a href="https://berniesanders.com/issues/green-new-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">key points</a> of the Greene New Deal are well-documented; it will create millions of jobs, ensure a just transition for everybody (including the present energy sector), put frontline communities first, and modernize our entire society. When I'm in congress, I will fight to implement the nitty-gritty legislation, which will most likely be done in phases. I will work with only the most fierce members of the House and Senate, open my office to the most well-regarded leaders and advocates for a green future, and help organize efforts to sponsor, co-sponsor, and write legislation which builds off our current proposals, and into a multiple-phased, multi-trillion dollar Green New Deal. </p><p><strong>Helping Local Small Businesses</strong><br>WE will help provide small business making less than $500,000 a year in revenue, and/or who have less than 10 full-time employees, with incentives such as subsidies and tax credits. Many small business owners need help, especially the mom and pop businesses that are part of the community, whether it be a family owned restaurant, convenience store, or grocery store. </p><p><strong>A Living Wage: $15 Federal Indexed Minimum Wage </strong><br>WE will fight for $15/hr federal indexed minimum wage, which is currently $7.25/hr. Just like the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/582/text" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Raise the Wage Act</a> (passed the House in 2019), the minimum wage will be indexed against the annual percentage increase in the median hourly wage of all employees as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and According to the Center for Economic and Policy Research. If the minimum wage had continued to move with average productivity after 1968, it would have reached $21.72 per hour in 2012! For the past 40 years, wages for the middle class have increased a mere 6%, while wages for the top 1% have increased 140%, total productivity has increased over 140%, and the cost of living has increased over 200%.</p><p>For small businesses, especially those in the community, the Government should provide assistance in the form of tax breaks, subsidies, and less regulations to help them cover the costs of an increased Federal Minimum Wage.</p><p><strong>Right to Unionize and Protecting Worker's Rights</strong><br>We will fight to give workers the right to unionize by introducing legislation like the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/5000" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Employee Free Choice Act</a> which would give employees more power and freedom to form a union if they have a majority vote to do so. We would also work to increase penalties on employers who send in union busters in an attempt to intimidate workers who want to unionize. We will repeal the Taft-Hartley Act which would also make it easier for people to join unions. Restoring workers right to organize and unionize will be to the benefit of all working people nationwide. Lastly, we would work to implement overtime for those making a salary of $47,000 or less. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>30-Hour Work Weeks</strong><br>We will push for the 30-hour work week (6 hours a day). What we see in America is employees working more than 40 hours, weekly, just to make ends meet. This takes away from quality family time and personal activities. In sprawling cities like Los Angeles, the amount of time it takes to get to and from work (even just a few miles) can result in an added 10 hours per week. While better public transit and higher pay is interwoven into the answer for a better standard of living, a 30-hour work week will go a long way in addressing the inequities of labor for the nation's poorest communities.</p><p><strong>Workers Cooperatives</strong><br>Democracy isn't just about voting every other year. When <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/content/Exxon-The-Road-Not-Taken?gclid=Cj0KCQjwiYL3BRDVARIsAF9E4GdeWaZEdX0LRjDULAjJSNf2LtneUrfRhtFboT2YJvaeDwDrcXEBEc8aAjWXEALw_wcB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Exxon hides its own scientists' warnings about climate change for over forty years</a> while funding groups that spread misinformation to protect its profits instead, we can see that even the survival of our species may depend on establishing democracy at work. Worker co-ops have proven the ability to provide workers with higher wages, and provide to their community healthy food, good  insurance, and ethically conscious banking options like credit unions. As a Government, we should encourage businesses that value their employees as an integral part of the work that they do. Through tax credits, subsidies, and grants, we will establish more cooperatives, targeting communities that have seen their small businesses shutter due to monopolies like large fast food chains, and retail hypermarkets such as Walmart. Cooperatives are a perfect horizontal model of laborers sharing in the wealth they create, instead of a top-down model where the profits of labor largely accumulate at the top.</p><p><strong>Fair Trade Deals</strong><br>WE will work to oppose any free trade agreements, including any sort of fast track that doesn’t give time or scrutiny on trade deals that do not give a fair deal to both counterparts to the United States and the country it is trading with. Our fair trade policies have failed the American worker shipping job overseas and competing against foreign workers who are working pennies on the dollar. We will also work to renegotiate disastrous trade deals like NAFTA and will continue the fight to make sure the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) does not pass which would give foreign entities the power to sue a government for missed profit due to regulations imposed by a country. In addition, we will fight to make sure no trade deal is made in private where no one, not even from Congress, has a say on the type of trade deals to be agreed upon.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Job Programs for The Youth</strong><br>WE will work to create job programs for the youth, especially in underserved communities, and reward them for excellence in school and serving their communities. The idea is that youth unemployment is currently at around 12% where youth of color lead the youth unemployment figure. If we can financially reward the youth with working responsibilities that can actually help build and improve their communities whether it be picking up trash to taking care of the elderly to creating and finding solutions, then we should be taking that opportunity to empower them with jobs.</p><p><strong>Redistribution of Wealth</strong><br>WE will work to decrease our military spending where currently 54% of our discretionary budget goes towards.  For example, the F-35 fighter jet program, is costing taxpayers over a trillion dollars. Instead we should put these funds into social programs such as Medicare for All, guaranteed income, tuition free public college and university, housing, and financial assistance to small businesses to boost our local and national economy. We will also work to audit inefficient and wasteful spending in government programs as well. For example, the US Army made trillions of dollars of accounting mistakes and often did not have the receipts or invoices needed to support figures in its budget.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Making Wall Street Pay Their Fair Share </strong><br>WE will work to incorporate a Financial Transaction Tax to ensure that no low-middle income wage earners pay more as a percentage of their income to taxes than higher income wage earners do.<br>    0.5% on Stocks<br>    0.1% on Bonds<br>    0.005% on Derivatives<br>    0.001% on all other Financial Securities</p><p>For example, in the LAST SEVEN business days of December 2017, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) had $213,954,582,805 worth of Stock Trades. If there were a financial transaction tax of 0.5% on those stocks, that would equate to $1,069,772,914 worth of revenue generated to go towards education.</p><p>That could cover 66,092 undergraduate students going to Cal State University of Los Angeles (CSULA), and only 27,000 are enrolled per year! That could also cover 47,791 undergraduate students going to UCLA for a year.</p><p>AND that's only SEVEN DAYS worth of trading from ONE stock exchange.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Reinstating Modern-Day Glass Steagall</strong><br>WE will work to reinstate Glass-Steagall which will separate commercial banking activity with investment banking activity. We will also work with Congress to break up the big banks because the banks have too much power that if they were to go underwater again by engaging in risky or fraudulent betting, millions of people will suffer just as we saw in the 2008 financial crisis.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Increasing Taxable Income CAP for Social Security</strong><br>WE will protect the right of seniors to retire with Social Security. WE oppose cutting benefits or raising the retirement age. WE will work to lift the cap on taxable income that goes towards social security for our elders. Currently, someone who makes $118,500 a year pays the same amount into social security as a billionaire. We will remove the cap so that the wealthy pay the same share of their income. This will also expand the life and solvency of the Social Security fund for more than 60 years.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Taxing Capital Gains at Ordinary Income</strong><br>WE will work to tax capital gains at the same rate as ordinary income. Many billionaire investors pay less of a percentage of their taxes on capital gains than people do on their ordinary income due to the fact that the capital gains tax is lower than ordinary income tax. This will apply only to those individuals making more than $250,000 a year in taxable income.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Taxing The Wealthiest Americans</strong><br>Like Bernie Sanders, WE will work to increase higher income tax rates on the richest 2% of households in America. Individuals making less than $200,000 or married couples making less than $250,000 will not have their income taxes increase. We will push for these progressive tax increases on the top three income tax brackets. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Making American Corporations Pay Their Fair Share</strong><br>WE will work to make sure that U.S. corporations are paying their fair share of corporate taxes by working to ensure that money being stashed overseas by Wall Street and large corporations are not deferred or delayed in paying taxes due to it being stashed overseas. We will work to close this tax loophole and ensure that income is taxed as they are earner no matter where the money is.</p><p><br></p><p>Many large companies incorporate their businesses in the Cayman Islands or other tax haven countries to delay or defer their tax liability. In addition, many large corporations are also having their manufacturing plants in countries with very low to no corporate tax rates. These are the tax incentives that we will be trying to close so that no matter where they are located, they still get taxed their fair share.</p><p><br></p><p>The revenue generated can used for public services such as rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, preserving our environment, or towards social services that should be considered a right such education and healthcare.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ending Corporate Subsidies</strong><br>WE will work to end corporate subsidies given to corporations who are more than capable of taking care of themselves. Every year over a trillion dollars in corporate welfare are being take advantage of by companies and their CEOs. From billions of dollars on tax breaks on CEO bonuses, to Wall Street and fossil fuel subsidies, to taxing capital gains lower than ordinary income, and to federal contracts for the biggest companies, it is clear the wealth and large companies are clearly capable of taking care of themselves. <br> </p><p>WE will work to end corporate subsidies for large multinational corporations and executives who are profitable and clearly capable of running their business without tax dollars.<br>Close tax loopholes for CEO/Executive compensation packages. Currently CEOs can write-off compensation packages, stock options, and performance-based bonuses.<br>End tax deductions for companies to writing off the purchase of luxury corporate jets and other luxurious vehicles.</p><p>We will work to eliminate Big Oil subsidies in order to move our nation towards clean renewable energy and to protect our environment.</p><p>We will work to eliminate pharmaceutical subsidies for big pharmaceutical companies who charge some of the highest drug prices in the world. Many of these pharmaceutical companies buy out the patents for drugs that were largely developed with taxpayer funds. Our government should be able to buy up the drug patents as soon as they are available to eliminate the monopoly of life-saving prescription drugs.<br> </p><p>We will work to eliminate wasteful spending on subsidies for Agri-business where farmers are taking advantage of programs by growing crops on land that is damaged or unproductive and making money off of insurance claims rather than on crops. WE will also eliminate subsidies for factory farms, which slaughter billions of animals every year while polluting our rivers and giving off greenhouse gases that make them one of the top causes of climate change.<br> </p><p>WE will eliminate corporate welfare for Wall Street by working to break up the big banks. They are too big to fail and have access to the purse of the Fed to borrow large amounts of money at little to zero interest rates. </p><p><br></p><p>In addition, we also want to make sure there is oversight over the use of federal funding used to provide these corporate subsidies to ensure that there is any growth or positive return on investment to better society.</p><h2><strong>Quality Public Education as a Right</strong></h2><p><strong>Education is a Right</strong></p><p>We believe that it is time to transform our educational system all the way from early child care through college and beyond. The time for Quality Public Education as a RIGHT is LONG OVERDUE. </p><p><strong>Tuition-Free Public College and University</strong><br>OUR campaign is calling for Tuition-Free Public College & Education regardless of how much one's family makes. We believe Universal Public Higher Education through College should be a RIGHT, just as we believe Universal Healthcare should be a RIGHT.</p><p>Nowadays, a college degree is required for most jobs in the private sector. In addition, a college education is key to success and survival in the competitive national and global economy because as many other nations (who do provide tuition free public college) know: Knowledge is Power.</p><p>How would we pay for it? A Wall Street Speculation Tax. Put a financial transaction tax per total trade dollar amount:<br>0.5% on Stocks, <br>0.1% on Bonds, <br>0.005% on Derivatives, and <br>0.001% on all other Financial Securities traded.</p><p>For example, in the LAST SEVEN business days of December, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) had $213,954,582,805 worth of Stock Trades.  If there were a financial transaction tax of 0.5% on those stocks, that would equate to $1,069,772,914 worth of revenue generated to go towards education.  That could cover 66,092 undergraduate students going to Cal State University of Los Angeles (CSULA), and only 27,000 are enrolled per year!  That could also cover 47,791 undergraduate students going to UCLA for a year.  AND that's only SEVEN DAYS worth of trading from ONE stock exchange.</p><p>Wall Street investment firms, hedge funds, etc. are MORE than capable of picking up this small progressive tax, it just depends on who's going to push for it.  We know the bought Democrats and Republicans won't because Wall Street are their biggest campaign supporters.  Wall Street & the Big Banks received $16 trillion in federal assistance from the Fed with close to zero percent interest to bailout the greed and recklessness of Wall Street that contributed to the Great Recession where 9 million people lost their jobs, 4 million homes were foreclosed, 2.5 million businesses were shut down, and millions of hardworking Americans saw their retirement disappear.  Wall Street & the Big Banks have recovered, but the American people HAVEN'T. It's time for them to pay their fair share!</p><p>It should be noted that this will pay for itself, every taxpayer dollar that goes into education generates $7 in return in revenue and public benefits, this is what gave way to the GI Bill after WW2.  In addition, the University of California (UC) Schools used to be free at least for California Residents before 1970.</p><p><strong>Cancellation of Student Debt</strong><br>As of 2016, there is currently $1.3 trillion of student debt outstanding with about 44 million Americans paying off their student loans.  Students leave around with an average of $35,000 in student debt with a 5-7% interest rate when they graduate, and 11% of students are likely to default on their payments.</p><p><br></p><p>For that 4.8 million who are likely to default, they are burdened with the socioeconomic effects of insecurity, damaged credit scores, wage garnishments, and can lose public employment or even a driver's license.</p><p>In Los Angeles, what we are seeing in areas with higher median income households are students with higher average loan balances especially with more expensive private colleges/universities but lower rates of delinquency meaning that those with money are able to take care of the costs. </p><p>However, in areas with lower median income households, students have lower loan balances attending more public colleges/universities, but are more likely to default on loan payments.  According to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, before the Great Recession, total outstanding student debt ranked well below mortgages, auto loans, credit cards and home equity lines of credit as sources of household debt. Now it trails only mortgage debt... Student loans are the new mortgages.</p><p>Student debt is polarizing our students as it becomes clear that a degree is now a requirement into the job market that doesn't exist.  50 years ago, one could not get hired a job without a high school degree; today, many employers won't even consider hiring someone without a college degree.  We believe it's time we bailout our students and forgive their student debt. We call on the Federal Reserve to buy back the $1.3 trillion outstanding in student loans and declare it uncollectable - null and void (write-off the debt).  The Fed was able to prop up more than $16 trillion in loans with close to zero percent interest to bailout the greed and recklessness of Wall Street that contributed to the Great Recession where 8.8 million people lost their jobs, 6 million homes were lost, and millions of hardworking Americans saw their retirement savings disappear ($3.4 trillion).</p><p>Bailing out our hardworking students and their parents will increase their cash flow, increase spending, increase the possibilities of idea creation and entrepreneurship, and give more quality time in finding that career path that they studied for so that they employ their full potential.  We will push for the student loan bailout through the Fed because like Bernie Sanders said, "The Federal Reserve must be reformed to serve the needs of working families, not just CEOs on Wall Street."</p><p><strong>Improve Public Education and Protection From Privitization</strong><br>We will work to ensure that no public schools are privatized or taken over by corporate charters that end up running schools like a business.  We oppose charter schools that don't agree to their districts' collective bargaining agreements with classified workers and teachers.  Charters shouldn't be used to bust unions. </p><p>We also share concerns about some charter schools that have served as vehicles for the enrichment of real estate speculators.  From speaking with teachers, a lot of these charter systems make it seem that the opportunity is equal for everyone, but some still screen students or give admission to those who have a special interest into the school's particular educational focus or sometimes make students write 5 page essays without grammatical errors, etc.  One of the reasons is because the schools need to have "numbers" (standardized test scores at a certain level).  Our strategy is to improve all public schools by providing them with the resources they need, rather than hiring teachers and classified workers with lower pay and benefits.  We will also oppose any voucher system that would re-direct public education funding to private schools, including through tax credits.  We believe that public schools should be a place for ALL students to have a quality education and should not be burdened by any financial desires from those "managing" the schools just to make profit.</p><p>Educators should have the freedom to be more innovative in their classes without restrictions by mandates, and teachers should have resources and technology incorporated as it is crucial in the learning environment, something that is currently being underutilized and underfunded. Right now, through this pandemic, we are seeing the impact that such a lack is having on the education of our children.</p><p>We also believe that educators should not be graded or measured based on standardized tests by students.  We believe that there should be adequate measures that will empower educators, such as a well-rounded curriculum that not only let's students learn the subject matters but also helps them become better members of their community.  The No Child Left Behind Act focuses heavily on math and literacy which takes away other opportunities for growth such as working in teams and creative/critical thinking which is crucial after graduating from school.  Also, many schools receive funding based on how well the schools perform in terms of standardized testing and that has a major drawback on educators and students especially with low-income families and communities of color who lack fewer resources to begin with.</p><p><br></p><p>We also believe that teachers should have additional resources when it comes to full inclusion teaching where teachers teach both special education and general education. This can put lots of pressure on the teachers as the teachers sometimes do not specialize in special education.  We will work to ensure critical consciousness among educators, making sure that teachers who are going into urban schools, have a critical education or theoretical background, and have an understanding of the systemic issues students are facing, especially students of color.  You cannot have a top down approach from people who have never set foot in the community that students come from. There needs to be community involvement, even from the students, when it comes to decision-and-policy-making in education.</p><p>We will work to make educational institutions more welcoming especially to students' parents whose first language is not English so that there is no intimidation and that there is a clear understanding between parents and educators.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>End School to Prison Pipeline</strong><br>We will work to end the school to prison pipeline, where schools have zero tolerance policies which we will work to remove.  According to the ACLU, "Zero-tolerance” policies criminalize minor infractions of school rules, while cops in schools lead to students being criminalized for behavior that should be handled inside the school.  Students of color and even undocumented students are especially vulnerable to push-out trends and the discriminatory application of disciplines.  This is why it's critical that the teachers and administrators come from a critical background because those who don't have their idea of what "defiance" is which is deemed as "unacceptable" behavior in their eyes.  Zero tolerance policies do not consider what is going on in the communities these students are coming from. </p><p><strong>Taking Care of Our Educators</strong></p><p>We will work hard to ensure that our teachers get paid more.  Currently, educators with a college degree are making around $31,000 starting pay.  Close to 50 percent of new teachers leave the profession with in the first 5 years due to low pay, while many teachers work multiple jobs because they cannot afford to qualify for mortgage loans, rent an apartment, or even have the money to pay off their student loans.  No one should have to go to school or work and worry about whether their rent will be paid or there will be food on the table.  Teachers give a lot of what they’re asked for which can be stressful and exhausting which might force them out of the profession to more lucrative positions if they are not being valued.  We will also work to give teachers more self-care days so that they have time to take care of themselves. </p><p><strong>Universal Pre-K and Head Start</strong><br>We will work to ensure Universal Pre-K high quality programs for 4 year-olds regardless of their parents' or families income, race, etc.  Research has shown that the earlier a child starts learning, the better he or she does in his or her future.  Currently, our country is not doing enough to give ALL kids that chance to learn and succeed in their early ages.  Three in ten 4-year-olds are currently enrolled in a high-quality preschool program.  Just like kindergarten is available to 5 and 6 year-old children, we believe that pre-k should be available as well to ALL children 4 years of age.  According to the National Association for the Education of Young children, the term universal pre-K means that these programs are available for any child in any state, regardless of the child’s abilities and family income.  Universal pre-K would also allow thousands of mothers to enter into the workforce and help families spend less on education and add additional income for a family.  Brain development during the years leading up to kindergarten lays out the foundation for child's future as well as it promotes creative learning, age appropriate educational exercises, the development of language, and early literacy, cognitive, and social skills.  This goes beyond the child's years; it lasts a lifetime.</p><p><br></p><p>We will also work to protect Head Start programs that prepare young children from low-income families, especially families of color.  Head Start provides children with early childhood development such as developing reading and math skills from birth to age 5 and they also provide nutritional services.  This takes off a heavy financial burden from low-income families and families of color as they can focus on being able to make an income and also not worry that their child is not getting the quality care they need.  From the Office of Head Start, Head Start has served over 30 million children and their families in urban and rural areas in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. territories. </p><h2><strong>Progressive Foreign Policy</strong></h2><p><strong>Foreign Policy Based on Prosperity and Peace</strong></p><p>In the international arena, we must work multilaterally to advance U.S. interests, not force them upon other nations through regime change.<br> </p><p>In Congress, we will always seek peaceful approaches, while advocating for the use of diplomacy, and not wage preemptive wars without being attacked or facing an immediate, unavoidable attack. It is time to put the breaks on the war machine.</p><p>In the same manner, we will work with countries that do not violate human rights, including women's rights and labor rights. We prioritize foreign aid to governments whose actions are consistent with our values and principles.  We propose the establishment on thorough military spending audits to find any wasteful spending or fraudulent charges from sub-contractors.<br> </p><p>We will create partnerships with other countries to grow small and medium businesses to bring jobs to the US. Reducing our military budget by 50%. Currently we use 50% of our discretionary budget on military spending.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Treaties</strong></p><p><br></p><ul><li><strong>Trade: We will renegotiate or withdraw from trade agreements like NAFTA to eliminate rules that enable investor-to-state lawsuits that can overturn health, safety, and environmental protections.</strong></li><li><strong>Finance: We will forgive the sovereign debt of highly-indebted developing countries and push for the IMF and World Bank to forgive these debts as well.</strong></li><li><strong>Sustainability:</strong> <strong>We will fund and transfer technology for renewable energy and environmental sustainability to developing countries as part of our commitment to stop climate disruption.</strong></li><li><strong>Climate:</strong> <strong>We will negotiate a follow up to the Paris climate accords so the world has a better chance of avoiding catastrophic climate disruption.</strong></li><li><strong>Robots:</strong> <strong>We will establish international regulation of standards for autonomous robots and drones so that they do not develop into a threat against humans.</strong></li><li><strong>Nuclear:</strong> <strong>We will negotiate with other nations to eliminate nuclear weapons.</strong></li><li><strong>Sea:</strong> <strong>We will negotiate protections for international waters to prevent unregulated fishing, mining, construction, and dumping, including within Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs), because the world's oceans are connected and pollution will flow. We will also promote the elimination of dirty bunker fuels from shipping, which is one of the major contributors to climate change.</strong></li><li><strong>Space:</strong> <strong>We will negotiate a United Nations treaty to ban weapons in space and to regulate the use of space and orbits.</strong></li></ul><h1><strong>Criminal Justice Reform</strong></h1><p><strong>Criminal Justice Reform</strong><br>From mass incarceration to police shootings and killings, and all the way to our court system of convicting officers' wrong doing, there is must needed room for criminal justice reform.  Public trust on our police departments have deteriorated over the years, especially with the use of cell phone videos and body cameras.  WE know that the excessive and deadly force used by the police has always been there, surveillance cameras have not.  This public distrust is valid because many people, including the Native American, African American, Latinx, LGTBQIA+ and the Disabled community, have been unjustly targeted and sometimes end up dead for minor issues like traffic stops, disproportionately to Whites.  WE are outraged that when officers do get charged with murder or manslaughter, most often than not, they never get convicted.</p><p><br></p><p>From the National spotlights of Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Tamir Rice, Freddie Gray, Walter Scott, Sandra Bland, Samuel DuBose, Philando Castile, to the local spotlights of Ezell Ford, Wakiesha Wilson, Jose Mendez and Jesse Romero, it is clear that there must be criminal justice reform.</p><p><strong>Demilitarize Police and Increase Accountability</strong><br>WE MUST hold police officers accountable. We need to establish Civilian & Police Review boards in local communities to have a balanced check on police and make sure they are held accountable for any related police incidents resulting in death or bodily harm to individuals, whether by accident or on purpose.</p><p><br></p><p>We must increase police training length, especially in terms of conflict resolution tactics. In some European countries, police training can go up to 3 years so that police can have ample time to learn to better understand, communicate with and calm distraught individuals. US police academies provided an average of 19 weeks of classroom instruction. We must also focus on increased training on de-escalation techniques instead of using deadly force.</p><p>We must demilitarize our police forces so that they don’t look and act like they are going to war with our own citizens.  Have mandatory community policing requirements of proportional representation where police officers look and act like the people in the communities they are supposed to protect and serve.</p><p><br></p><p>Ensure that mental health patients who call law enforcement for help will be treated as medical patients, not criminals.  In addition, we need to invest in medical and mental help programs to deal with those having substance abuse issues.  We should be treating them from a health perspective, not a criminal perspective.</p><p><strong>End the School to Prison Pipeline</strong></p><p>We must put an end to the school to prison pipeline. Invest more on youth jobs and education, not jails and incarceration.  This involves ending the war on drugs that targets people of color disproportionately compared to our White counterparts.  In addition, we need to take marijuana off the federal government's list of outlawed drugs / the DEA's Schedule 1 drug list where Heroin is on that same list.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ban Private Prisons</strong></p><p>It is time to end the for-profit prisons industry with a direct ban. The prison industrial complex has led to a disproportionate amount of mass incarceration people of color and low-income people. In the United States, we have the world's highest level of prisoners (over 2 million prisoners) compared to any other country.</p><p><strong>End Mandatory Minimums</strong></p><p>We must eliminate mandatory minimums, which we have seen negatively affect tougher sentencing for Black and Brown people than Whites.  According to the Yale Law Journal, Black men were nearly twice as likely to be charged with an offense that carried a mandatory minimum sentence than White men facing similar circumstances.  Judges historically have selected longer and tougher sentences for Blacks, even if they have the same criminal history as Whites.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Use of Force</strong></p><p>We will evaluate and reform our current laws regarding the "use of lethal force" to ensure that police officers who are in the wrong of unjustly killing people are indicted AND convicted.  There is an overwhelming number of police shootings each year that ends up as "justifiable" in the eyes of the law however, when we see cases like that of Walter Scott, who was shot 3 times in the back while running away, or Eric Garner who was choked to death even though his hands were up and there was large presence of police officers around, it begs to question: what must you do to get an indictment or a conviction for  police officers?  There is too much leeway for law enforcement officers who get away using lethal force. there must be reform. </p><h1><strong>Humane Immigration Reform</strong></h1><p>We are a nation of Natives as well as immigrants, and some of our most valued possessions came from the minds of immigrants.  As Americans, we must be welcoming to those just like our parents, those that come from a past we will never fully understand, and those that just want to provide the best for themselves and their children. </p><p>For those that want to come in this country with documentation, we commend you for working hard in your current country, saving up money in order to live the U.S. with Documented status.  For the 11 million undocumented immigrants (3% of the U.S. population) who are here currently, we must allow them to come out of the shadows without fear of deportation and hefty financial penalties.  Many have escaped from a country where war, crime, and poverty has overcome their homes, which we can take a part of responsibility through U.S. Imperialism, bad trade deals, and wars.  We should be uniting families not separating them.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Building a Movement for Citizenship</strong><br>WE recognizes that it is very difficult for immigrants, documented and undocumented, under our outdated immigration system to become a U.S. Citizen and to come out of the shadows.  We recognize that change can happen only from the bottom-up, and not from the top-down.  With our election into Congress, we will mobilize millions of Americans of all races, especially the Latinx and Immigrant community to fight for the change they need one election at a time.  These people will elect officials who recognize the importance of comprehensive immigration reform and will seek a welcoming path to citizenship.  </p><p><strong>Full Legal Status for All Immigrants</strong><br>WE will push for legislation that will provide legal status for ALL immigrants! </p><p>Citizenship for DREAMers.</p><p><br>WE will work to pass a modern day DREAM Act which would allow undocumented immigrants who came into the United States before the age of 16 an expeditious pathway to citizenship.  In addition, we will work to expand educational benefits such as receiving financial aid and be eligible for in-state tuition rates. </p><p><strong>Healthcare for All Immigrants</strong></p><p>WE will fight for undocumented immigrants to receive adequate health care through Medicare for ALL. In the near term, we will support expansion of Medicaid to cover undocumented immigrants.  No one should face death or struggle to receive the healthcare they need because they could not receive any healthcare due to their undocumented status. </p><p><strong>Right to Counsel</strong><br>WE will work with Congress to fight for Undocumented Immigrants to have Legal Representation, especially for children who currently have to represent themselves in front of a judge in immigration hearings.  It does not make sense to have trial and not have legal representation especially if you are not familiar with the law.  It is very sad to know that there are 10 or 12 years who have to defend themselves in front of a judge against getting deported. </p><p><strong>Whistle-Blower Protection</strong><br>WE will protect all workers regardless of immigration status who report employers who exploit them by making them work in unsafe work conditions that violate health codes or safety codes.  We will fight for undocumented workers who get threatened with no pay, overtime, or wages withheld due to threat of being deported.  Currently, many undocumented do not file any complaints in fear of being deported, it's time to change that.</p><p><strong>Ban and Close All Detention Centers</strong><br>WE will work with Congress to end ALL detention centers whose main goal it is to increase their bottom line at the expense of separating families and deporting undocumented immigrants.  In addition, we will fight to ensure that if they are released for non-violent crimes that they don't get deported the minute they get out of jail. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Abolish ICE</strong></p><p>WE will work with Congress to defund ICE.  If we are made aware of an ICE checkpoint in our district, our will staff inform the community.  We will tweet, post and share so our community is able to stay safe and protect their loved ones from separation.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Lessen the Burden of Proof for Asylum Seekers</strong></p><p>WE will protect immigrants, especially children, who flee their home country because they are victims of domestic violence and criminal gang activity or war.  Currently, it’s not good enough to tell or convince the government that if you get sent back to a war torn country like Honduras, you might die unless you prove that people want to kill you because of your race, political identity, etc.  Children are saying if "I go back, I’m going to get killed by gangs", however, our government says “you can’t prove that”.  Children should NOT have to prove that.  We should lower the burden of proof so that children and families can keep their life. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ensure Immigration Courts are Sufficiently Staffed and Funded</strong><br>WE will fight to ensure that immigrants are given a sufficient amount of time to defend themselves in immigration hearings.  Currently, judges can decide immigrants’ fate, including children and families, in 7 minutes without sufficiently reviewing all the evidence and circumstances. Seven minutes can decide a family's future, that is unfair.</p><p><strong>End the 3 to 10-Year Bar</strong><br>WE will fight to end the 3 to 10-year bar on undocumented immigrants who leave the United States to apply for a Visa from their own home countries and try to come back to America for a better life.  What we're seeing are people going back to their home country to obtain their Visa but getting denied and up getting stuck in their country 3 - 10 years.  A majority of undocumented immigrants won’t do it and will live here in the shadows.</p><h1><strong>Housing is a Human Right</strong></h1><p><strong>Housing for All</strong></p><p>We believe that housing is a human RIGHT.  No one should ever be priced out of their homes or not be able to afford to have a roof over their head. </p><p><br></p><p>The growing disparity between the rich and the poor only proves once again, that those who have money can move into places like the San Fernando Valley, rent or live in new homes or luxury apartment complexes, drive up prices, and displace those who have been living here their entire lives.  Gentrification is one of the major issues among constituents here in CA District 29. </p><p>Most of these major developments are being approved by our Democratic elected officials without regard to the community in which they're being developed. In addition, these Democratic elected officials are receiving hundreds of thousands of dollars from these large developers.  It is time to make Housing a Human RIGHT, stopping Gentrification, and enacting Universal Rent Control.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Affordable and Low-Income Housing</strong><br>We will work to expand to expand the National Affordable Housing Trust, created by Senator Sanders, to set aside funds to go towards affordable housing projects for low to extremely low income households.  These funds would enable state and local governments to build millions of affordable housing units and also create jobs in the process.  We will work with Federal and Local government to negotiate with structural developers to develop affordable housing units.</p><p>We will fight for legislation where new apartment complexes have to ensure 20% of the units are for Affordable Housing (where rent is 30% or less of the area median income) and 30% of the units are for low income housing (where rent is more than 30% of the area median income).  We will work to provide federal subsidies for affordable housing developers who develop ONLY 100% units for affordable housing especially for low to extremely low income households.  We will also work to encourage more infill housing where local governments can utilize existing land or buildings, such as abandoned property-undeveloped property to be used for public and affordable housing. </p><p>We will also work to end speculation buying coupled with vacancy for long periods of time just for the purpose of making short or long-term profits when that land could be used to address the shortage of affordable housing.  We would encourage the President to use the Department of Housing and Urban Development to grant or withhold funds in order to encourage state and local governments to take positive steps to desegregate housing, including ending zoning laws that effectively prohibit multi-family housing, prohibiting landlords from refusing to accept Section 8 vouchers, increasing Section 8 voucher amounts so that poor people can move into middle income neighborhoods, and building new public housing in middle income communities that is high quality and mixed income.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Public Housing</strong><br>WE will work to increase funding for Public Housing.  Currently, only 1.2 million households live in public housing and are only limited to low-income families and individuals, which is a very small number needed in a time where people can't afford a place to live.  There is a stigma in America about Public Housing rooted from the images of overcrowding and poor living conditions, but this is only the product of the failure of our government officials who give the state and local officials too much control and say in how much federal funding they should receive, where to build public housing, how to preserve decent living conditions, and who gets to live in public housing.  However, Public Housing in cities like Vienna and countries like Sweden have been successful, because they understand the growing populations and the need for an affordable place to live, while in America we lack that foresight and allow developers to squeeze every dollar out of us just so they can make a profit. Successes in Vienna and countries like Sweden are the result of 1) having adequate funding for the need of public housing and 2) encouraging mixed-class tenancy.  For mixed-class tenancy, priority still goes to low-income families, BUT if they are able to get back up on their feet with a job, they can still live there. In addition, when low-to-middle income families leave Public Housing, their governments actually help them find a new living place through a complex arrangement of land sales, loans and low-cost developments.</p><p><strong>Stopping Displacement and Gentrification</strong><br>WE will work with Federal, State, and Local Governments to ensure that developers first get approval from neighborhood councils and the community, not from their local government, in order to build new buildings, apartment complexes, and retail spaces that have the potential for the harmful effects of gentrification.  If developers come in and displace members of the community, the government or developers must make those displaced “whole” as if they never were displaced by providing subsidies or vouchers to help pay for the cost of relocation and rent or cost of their new living place for the next 5 years. Gentrification in the San Fernando Valley is a real issue and most of those affected are communities of color (mainly Latinx) that have lived there their entire lives only to be displaced because profits matter over people.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Universal Rent Control</strong><br>We will work to ensure that Universal Rent Control is in place to make sure that no rent increases are more than 3% a year.  It's very scary knowing your rent might increase 10-50% next year because the existing landlord sold the apartment complex to a new developer or a new developer is building a new luxury apartment just a block over forcing the existing landlord to compete by raising prices.</p><p><strong>Stopping Evictions</strong><br>We will work to impose an immediate moratorium on foreclosures and evictions.  We will also work to stop illegal evictions of tenants especially under the threat of cash for keys where landlords threaten the tenant to "leave or else they will be removed under the law", and will usually offer cash to the tenant to leave.  We will also work to restrict eviction for long-term tenants including the elderly and disabled.  We will work to catch land lords who refuse to maintain their properties in habitable condition, or who engage in illegal evictions, with hefty fines and, in extreme cases, jail terms. </p><p><strong>Tenant's Right</strong><br>We will work to guarantee tenant's rights, including: freedom from harassment and evictions without just cause; well-enforced habitability standards; strong anti-discrimination enforcement, including family protection laws and domestic partnerships; continuation of established services and amenities; the right to reasonable guest visitation; maintenance of roommate privileges; and the right to communicate with other tenants about conditions or circumstances in their buildings.  We will also work to fund public and non-profit tenant-related counseling and legal assistance for renters. </p><p><strong>Homeowner Assistance</strong></p><p>We will work to provide financial assistance for first-time homeowners especially when it comes to acquiring a new loan, putting down-payments, or any other type of payment assistance.  We will also ensure that credit score reform is underway as the average credit score needed to borrow money from creditors is around 740 when it used to be in the 600s.  Those who took a hit during the housing crisis in 2008 have also had their credit scores effected negatively.  We will also work to provide financial assistance and refinancing for homeowners who still owe more in interest than the principal of their homes.  It is extremely discouraging to not fully own a house and know that as time has gone by, you're still paying down the interest. </p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Ending Homelessness</strong></h2><p>The United States has over 550,000 sleeping on the streets on any given night, with 20% of that number being children.  Close to 60,000 people live on the streets of Los Angeles County, while around 25,000 live in the city of Los Angeles, and up to 7,000 of that number live in the Northeast San Fernando Valley.  It is an embarrassment that as the wealthiest nation on earth, we have some of the highest levels of homelessness among industrialized nations.  We can help and treat the symptoms of homelessness as much as we can but we must tackle the root causes.<br> </p><p>The #1 cause for homelessness is that people cannot afford a home to live in.  One out of every five families in our District lives in poverty and rent is starting to move up to $1,500 a month, all the way up to $2,500 a month with the median gross rent of $1,200 a month.  In addition, many of those experiencing chronic homelessness are veterans and people with mental illnesses or substance abuse issues. </p><p>Housing as a Right, Homeless Programs, and Healthcare Reform go hand-in-hand to prevent and treat homelessness.  There is no one solution to treating homelessness and we must be open in helping those living on the streets, especially the children.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Prevent Homelessness</strong><br>The #1 cause for homelessness is not having enough affordable and low-income housing.  As part of our "Housing is a Right" Platform, we will work to build more affordable and low-income housing units, stop gentrification, enact universal rent control of 3% per year, stop illegal evictions, preserve renter's rights, and provide assistance for homeowners (first-time and underwater).  Other ways we can prevent homelessness and fighting poverty in general are increasing the minimum wage to $15 nationally, providing guaranteed healthcare through a single payer system, providing quality public education as a right, and guaranteeing a job for anyone willing to work.</p><p><strong>End Chronic Homelessness</strong><br>According to the Housing of Urban Development (HUD), a Chronically Homeless Individual refers to an individual with a disability who has been continuously homeless for 1 year or more or has experienced at least four episodes of homelessness in the last 3 years where the combined length of time homeless in those occasions is at least 12 months.  To end chronic homelessness, we will work to provide more permanent supportive housing units which has proven to be a cost-effective solution (saving over $10,000 per person) to ending chronic homelessness.  Permanent supportive housing is a program designed to provide housing (project and tenant-based) and supportive services on a long-term basis to formerly homeless people.  We would also push to allow the homeless to take part in the decision making process in finding solutions for their short and long-term situations. </p><p><strong>Families, Women, Children and Victims</strong><br>We will work to provide more new rapid re-housing capacity to prevent and end homelessness for families with children.  Rapid Rehousing is a housing model designed to provide temporary housing assistance to people experiencing homelessness, moving them quickly out of homelessness and into permanent housing.  We will also work to provide more Transitional Housing Programs to provide services and housing for homeless victims of domestic violence and sexual assault who require an emergency transfer from their current assisted housing into permanent housing away from their abusers.</p><p>We will work to create more drop-in centers for unsheltered homeless individuals.  We will work to ensure access to emergency shelters without barriers for families, unaccompanied youth, and women.  We would work to create more Basic Centers for runaway youth that would create temporary emergency shelters, food, clothing and referrals for health care.  In addition, we'd work to provide family counseling, recreation programs, and aftercare services for youth once they leave the shelter.  We will work to build on the Street Outreach Program which provides educational and prevention services to run away and street youth who have been subject to, or are at risk of, sexual exploitation or abuse.  The program works to establish and build relationships between youth and program outreach staff in order to help youth get off the streets.</p><p><strong>Healthcare for the Homeless</strong><br>We will work to provide Health Care for the Homeless by providing healthcare as a right for anyone and everyone in the United States without bias or discrimination.  This would help the homeless community by providing substance abuse treatment, emergency care/services, and outreach services to assist difficult-to-reach people experiencing homelessness in accessing healthcare.</p><p>We will work to ensure that drug abuse or mental health issues are not treated criminally but rather with an understanding that rehabilitation is needed.  We will also work to enable communities to expand and strengthen their treatment services for individuals experiencing homelessness with substance abuse disorders, mental illness, or co-occurring substance abuse disorders and mental illness.</p><p><strong>Education and Job Training</strong></p><p>We will work to provide educational opportunities such as quality public education for high school students and tuition-free public college & university for those wanting to attend college.  In addition, we will work to provide a guaranteed job program for those transitioning out of homelessness and back into the workforce. </p><h1><strong>Protecting Civil Rights</strong></h1><h2>At a time when our civil rights are under attack by a conservative government and Donald Trump, we must ALL stand united ready to resist and to fight back against any form of oppression, bigotry, xenophobia, sexism, or racism.  We must realize that our strengths and what makes America great is our diversity, our culture, and our differences.  To be able to be the most diverse country on Earth is why we are the wealthiest and most industrialized nation on earth.  We must treat each other with respect, compassion, and with dignity regardless of the color of one's skin, their gender identity, who they love, or what faith someone practices.  We cannot go back towards the days of segregation and a life based on fear, we must only move forward.</h2><p>​</p><p><strong>Racial Justice</strong><br>Black Lives Matter: We must recognize that there is a problem in the United States of America that has stemmed from the roots of slavery which has played an effect on the social conditioning of society today. Our system in the U.S. has failed the African American community.  African Americans are disproportionately incarcerated, unemployed, homeless, lack quality education, live near unsafe environmental conditions, face tougher prison sentences, and more likely to be killed by police compared to other racial groups other than Native Americans.  We will work to overthrow the current system that has failed African Americans and people of color so that they have the same chances to succeed as everyone else should.</p><p>​</p><p>Latinx Justice: African Americans and Latinx make up half of the total prisoners in America even though they represent only a quarter of the entire population.  Like the African American community, the system has also failed the Latinx community as well as they too face a disproportion of incarceration, unemployment, lack of quality education, imminent threats of deportation, and live near unsafe environmental conditions.</p><p>As discussed we must combat a system of wealth and income inequality that has had a profound effect on the African American and Latinx community.  We must provide quality public education and healthcare as a right, a living wage, affordable housing, and more opportunities for work.</p><p>We must reform our criminal justice system that disproportionately targets African Americans and Latinx, leaving them incarcerated or killed at the hands of police.  In addition, we will work to ensure that African Americans do not receive tougher sentencing than white people with the same history.  We will stop racial discrimination in education against students, including punishments for behavior or preferential treatment  based on race. We will also ensure quality public education as a right for all races.  We push for the Voting Rights Advancement Act, which would strengthen voting rights by expanding and strengthening the government's ability to respond to voting discrimination on the basis of race, color, gender identity, sexual preference, or membership in a language minority group.  We will work to pass the Safe Schools Improvement Act, which would amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) to require school districts in state that receive ESEA funds to adopt codes of conduct specifically prohibiting bullying and harassment, including on the bases of race, color, national origin, sex, disability, sexual orientation, gender identify, and religion </p><p>​</p><p><strong>Women's Rights</strong><br>Equal pay: WE will work with Congress to come up with a way to ensure that there is equal pay regardless of gender or race.  If people are working the same position with the same amount of skill and job experience, they should be paid the same.  Women of Color are actually paid even less compared to white males.  We will support legislation like the Paycheck Fairness Act to stop gender wage discrimination.  Also, we will work to raise the federal minimum wage to $15.</p><p>Right to choose / Pro-Choice: We will work to protect a woman’s reproductive rights and their right to choose what she decides to do with her body.  We will provide safe and legal to access to social services, medicine, and abortion, such as protecting Planned Parenthood.  We will provide quality child care as a right, including more Head Start programs and universal pre-k for working and newly mothers.  Mother’s deserve all the necessary help in the beginning phases of their children’s lives.  While they are working to make a living for her family, they must also have help in raising her child to be the best they can be.</p><p>We will work to pass legislation that provides 12 weeks of guaranteed paid family and medical leave.</p><p><strong>LGBTQIA+ Rights</strong><br>We will work to ensure that the future of this nation considers the rights of the LGBTQIA+ community and any other marginalized community as HUMAN Rights.</p><p>We will work to cosponsor and pass the Equality Act, which would add protections for sexual orientation and gender identity to the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  The Equality Act would prohibit worker, education, segregation, and public services discrimination on the basis of sex, gender identity, and sexual orientation, and for other purposes.  We will work to pass the Respect for Marriage Act (RMA), which would repeal the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) and guarantee that the federal government will respect legal marriages of same-sex couples and provide them with federal spousal rights and protection.  We will work to pass the Social Security and Marriage Equality (SAME) Act which would amend the federal code to ensure all lawfully married same-sex couples will receive Social Security spousal benefits, regardless of where they live.  We will work to pass the Stop Harming Our Kids Act that would encourage states to prohibit licensed counselors and therapists from engaging in dangerous practices to try to change the sexual orientation or gender expression of LGBTIA+ minors, known as “conversion therapy,” “reparative therapy,” “ex-gay therapy,” or “sexual orientation change effort?”  We will pass a single payer Medicare for ALL system that would cover HIV/AIDS screenings & treatment and medically necessary sex reassignment surgeries and treatments for insured individuals diagnosed by a physician with Gender Identity Disorder or Gender Dysphoria.</p><p><strong>Native Rights</strong><br>We stand in solidarity with our indigenous sisters and brothers facing threats of pipelines being built on their land.  We will work to ensure that all treaties are honored and respected by the United States government and the companies that try to build on and extract resources from sacred lands.  In addition, we must empower tribal sovereignty in order for tribes to protect and restore their sacred lands.  We must also ensure that with tribal sovereignty that tribes can carry out their own prosecution and have jurisdiction over crimes or actions taking place on tribal lands. </p><p>We will work to ensure that Native Americans have equal access to safety, education, healthcare, and affordable housing, as currently wealth and income inequality hits hardest for Native Americans.  1 out of 4 Native Americans live in poverty with a high school graduation rate of 67%, a lack of adequate healthcare and housing, poor infrastructure, and the highest risk of killing by police compared to all other racial groups. As part of our platform we are fighting for criminal justice reform, universal healthcare, public education as a right, a Green New Deal, and housing as a right. </p><p>​</p><p><strong>Religious Liberties</strong><br>We will work to ensure that there is a separation between church and state and that public law should be independent of anyone’s religion.</p><p>​</p><p>We will protect the freedom to express your religious faith or non-religious faith as upheld by the Free Exercise Clause in the First Amendment, and oppose any legislation that indiscriminately targets people from a certain religion to enter the country such as Donald Trump's travel ban that affects predominantly Muslim countries.</p><h1><strong>Caring for Our Veterans</strong></h1><p><strong>Care for Veterans and Current Service Members </strong></p><p>It is important that we take care of those who have served our country.  It is essential that we not only give them and their families the help they need but also show them that the government is there for them 100% no matter what.  The horrifying and shocking realities surrounding the veteran population needs to be addressed: 20 veterans a day commit suicide, 50,000 live on the streets, 495,000 veterans are unemployed, and PTSD afflicts almost 31 percent of Vietnam veterans, 10 percent of Gulf War (Desert Storm) veterans, 11 percent of veterans of the war in Afghanistan, and 20 percent of Iraqi war veterans.  In addition, the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) needs increased funding and resources to ensure sufficient staff and enough medical equipment, resources and adequate facilities to help solve the aforementioned issues.</p><p>​</p><p>We will fight to ensure more adequate funding for the VA to:</p><ul><li>Hire more staff to sufficiently care for our veterans and their families at pre, during, and post deployment</li><li>Utilize and train on using technology to remove inefficiencies such as administrative work/filings</li><li>Build more medical facilities including hospitals and mental health clinics to ensure veterans receive the proper medical and mental health care they need. We must also ensure that veterans can get treated at any hospital or facility outside of the VA to address the concerns of long wait times to get treated</li><li>Hire more doctors for the VA to also ensure veterans are getting the timely treatment needed.</li><li>Develop more housing for veterans so that when they come back home, they have a place to live</li><li>Guarantee jobs for our veterans so that we can apply our veterans' strengths in helping them achieve the career path they wish to pursue when transitioning back to civilian life</li><li>Providing education as a right whether it be private or public, veterans should get the education they want and need to compete in this global competitive economy</li><li>Help our homeless veterans off the streets by providing rapid re-housing and homelessness prevention programs and clinical services</li></ul></div><div class="text-center"><div class="Body9-sc-1rnu18a-0 CampaignWebsite__BallotpediaNoData-sc-1xgfrdn-1 jGPYvs"
