lack of quality healthcare choices at affordable prices is tearing away at the health and safety of American families, and I’ve seen this firsthand with many of my loved ones. We need to reform our current system to ensure that all citizens can be covered with the comprehensive plan that works for them. There are multiple paths to achieve this, but whatever we choose, it must keep and strengthen the protections for those with pre-existing conditions and it must be affordable for everyone. I will work tirelessly on these reforms to build the bridge to the future where universal coverage is the standard for care.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile we build to this future, we must not forget the struggles of those in rural communities, who may have to drive great distances to receive care. Also, we have to address the hidden suffering of individuals who need mental health services. It is crucial that we provide a safe environment for those citizens to seek the help that they need, and not feel confined to the shadows.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EGun Violence\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe consequences of gun violence are shown to us day after day at an alarming rate. In 2017 nearly 40,000 people died from gun violence, more people than died in car accidents. Women in America are 21 times more likely to die from gun violence than in other comparable developed nations, and firearms are the second-leading cause of death amongst U.S. children (NEJM 2018). There are several concrete steps that Congress can take now that would keep guns out of the hands of legally restricted purchasers and remove guns from people showing threatening behavior. These actions are supported by majorities of Americans, regardless of political party, but are blocked by special interest groups. They include Universal Background Checks, which would require private gun sellers to use the same background check system currently used by licensed gun dealers, and expansion and implementation of Red Flag Laws that allow family members or law enforcement to petition a judge to temporarily remove guns from a person who is seen to be a risk to themselves or others. Currently only 17 states have some form of risk-based gun removal laws and strong majorities of Americans from across the political spectrum support these laws.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI have been in the classroom with children during school lockdown drills. I have comforted sobbing second graders clasping chapter books or pencils to be thrown as weapons to distract would be killers that prey on our innocents. We owe these children, I owe my children, action to help deter any harm. We can #DoSomething!\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EWomen’s Right to Choose\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWomen’s health choices, and especially their reproductive choices, are some of the most personal and intimate decisions a person can make. Congress needs to empower women to make their own choices when it comes to what is right for them, in consultation with medical professionals. Additional resources must be allocated at the local level to ensure that comprehensive, age-appropriate sexual education is available to all. Further, it is long overdue to fix that birth control cannot be purchased as an over-the-counter medication. I will fight to make quality birth control options available for all who want it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EStudent Loan Reform\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe costs of higher education have been rising at a far higher rate than homes, utilities and even healthcare. This has put young people and their families in the position on taking on increasingly large amounts of debt to finance their dreams and ambitions.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EStudents must be allowed to refinance their existing loans to receive the same low interest rates that the biggest banks do when borrowing money. Corporations that benefit from an educated workforce should chip in more to both college and vocational education.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe existing public service loan repayment program must be streamlined so that graduates who choose a career in public service, including teachers, have the confidence that their debts will be forgiven after they complete the 10 years of work. It is shameful that currently under one percent of applicants in this program are ultimately granted relief. I also believe that we need to reform and expand existing government programs that will increase the amount of students graduating with degrees in mental healthcare and many other medical fields by offering some level of student loan forgiveness to help alleviate the giant student loan cost of obtaining these crucial to our communities skills and services.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EEnvironment\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EPreserving our lands, air, and waterways is a key policy priority for me. In addition to ensuring our air and water is clean and safe, we can improve our economy with the right legislation. By utilizing the latest technology in energy production, we can make Ohio’s second district a hub for energy innovation. We can achieve this by shifting existing tax breaks away from the largest polluters and direct those funds into new innovative technologies. By doing this we can both lower the cost of power and spread well-paying jobs of the future throughout the second district.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EOpioid Crisis\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESouthern Ohio has been ground zero for the opioid epidemic. As an educator I have seen firsthand the devastating effects that addiction has on individuals, families, and the broader community. I will fiercely advocate for increased funding for both prevention and rehabilitation measures, and I will hold accountable the prescription drug companies that have profited from this crisis.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EJob Development\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMy career trajectory has crossed many fields. These have included teaching, being a successful entrepreneur, and being a stay at home mom. Something has remained true throughout my life and that is that I believe in the importance of dignity of work. This means valuing our existing workers and helping those who struggle to find jobs.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe government can help develop jobs by encouraging entrepreneurship by adjusting zoning codes (working with the local communities), helping to facilitate walkable business districts, simplifying local regulations for start-ups, and by offering resources to help businesses grow. Opening a business can be overwhelming with all of the codes and regulations to understand. We can make local laws easier to understand supporting a diverse crowd of small businesses and innovation.&nbsp;&nbsp; Local economies have a lot to gain through job creation and income generation by empowering small businesses to succeed.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor far too long blue-collar work has been stigmatized and underpaid. We need to invest in job training programs to increase our workers’ skills and abilities. We also need to support workers’ ability to organize and bargain collectively in a global economy. I know that when Ohio’s workers are given a fair shot, we will always prove our worth. I look forward to traveling throughout our district to learn more from the people and to partner with them to help our communities

Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p><p class="survey-response">I am not a career politician nor ever thought to be one. When I learned that no one was stepping up to run against the current Representative for my district, whom many are not happy with, I came forward to run. I believe that I am better in touch with what the people of my district want and need. I have many life experiences that will help to my shape my public service decisions. I am currently a teacher for Cincinnati Public Schools and I reside in Cincinnati's easternmost neighborhood Mt. Washington. I taught full time before marriage and kids, but took a break from teaching to raise my kids. While at home with them, I started a small business creating sewn projects for clients ranging from individuals to large businesses. I learned a lot about the challenges small businesses face. Three years ago, I returned to teaching part time. While my previous full time teaching job was teaching English at the high school level, now I work with all grades Pre-K through 12, teaching various subjects including gym, art, music, and often with small special needs groups. I have worked in various schools with many students and teachers. This dynamic job has given me an unique view as to many educational successes and areas needing improvement. I am from Greenhills, Ohio and am one of five children. Both my parents worked for the city of Cincinnati but are now living in Adams County Ohio. My life spreads across our district and I want to be present throughout it and stay in touch.</p></div><div class="survey-result"><p class="survey-question">Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?</p><ul class="key-messages"><li>Expand single payer healthcare with the goal of universal healthcare for all (including mental healthcare)</li><li>Reform school loan financing with an expansion of federal subsidies for public service and healthcare service</li><li>Expand and create programs to aid rural Americans with improvements in healthcare access and job creation and training.</li></ul></div><div class="survey-result"><p class="survey-question">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p><p class="survey-response">As a teacher, supporting public education is very important to me. We need to rely on educational experts as to the best ways to serve teachers and students. Access to healthcare, medicine, and mental health services must be improved. We need more healthcare professionals and better proximity to services. Environmental protections must be strengthened not deregulated. I will not sell out to big business at the cost of pollution. Gun violence can be decreased if all parties come to the table to discuss ways to help. Strengthening background check implementation and instilling red flag laws are ways to start. Women's Rights must be protected. Instead of trying to control women's bodies, standardized sex education based on science and health needs to be created. Access to birth control in the form of an over the counter birth control pill would also help decrease the amount of unplanned pregnancies. Many other reforms are needed: criminal justice, immigration, campaign finance - all of these have been dirtied by for profit agendas. We need to put people first!</p></div><div class="survey-result"><p class="survey-question">Is there a book, essay, film, or something else you would recommend to someone who wants to understand your political philosophy?</p><p class="survey-response">No. I am still discovering. Maybe I need to write a book?</p></div><div class="survey-result"><p class="survey-question">What characteristics or principles are most important for an elected official?</p><p class="survey-response">Integrity Diplomacy Intelligence Empathy Adaptability Being a good listener Being effective (following through with legislation that had positive results for the people and country) I like to see a good sense of humor too - it shows a person's humanity.</p></div><div class="survey-result"><p class="survey-question">What qualities do you possess that you believe would make you a successful officeholder?</p><p class="survey-response">Integrity Diplomacy Intelligence Empathy I am a fantastic listener I get things done I have a good sense of humor too Truly - I do not think that I am corruptible and that is a very good start.</p></div><div class="survey-result"><p class="survey-question">What do you believe are the core responsibilities for someone elected to this office?</p><p class="survey-response">A person elected to this office must always put the interest of the people first. Country before party, country before big business, country before your religious views, country above self. Too often elected officials put agendas first that are based on selfish reasons.</p></div><div class="survey-result"><p class="survey-question">What legacy would you like to leave?</p><p class="survey-response">If I only serve one term but do it with such integrity and empathy, fighting for those who haven't been heard... if I get to Washington and always side with the people regardless of my future campaign contributions from corporate interest, then I have done a worthy job. I have no political ego nor big pictures of me in some lofty position. I have been thrown into this situation but am doing it willingly and fearlessly because people need a choice and people deserve politicians that are not corrupt. I want my legacy to be as a honorable, brave servant of the people.</p></div><div class="survey-result"><p class="survey-question">What is the first historical event that happened in your lifetime that you remember? How old were you at the time?</p><p class="survey-response">The first historical event that happened in my life that I remember was the Challenger explosion. I was in the fourth grade (age 9) which is the same age that my son is now actually (which helps to put things into perspective better). It was a big deal to watch happening live as my teacher was super excited about the Challenger because of there was a civilian teacher on board named Christa McAuliffe. She was chosen from thousands of applicants and was living out so many people's dream. We had a big old box TV's up on a corner shelf above the chalk board and we turned on the news channel that best came through. We sat on the floor Indian Style (criss-cross applesauce we call it now!) and all stared up in anticipation and excitement. It really is something to see a shuttle launch. However, it is something all together different to see a shuttle launch and then seconds later blow into pieces. I remember we all looked immediately at our teacher for understanding , but she fell apart. There were a lot of tears. We cried hard for the humanity lost. Fast forward to 2001. I was teaching a 10th grade English class when a cell phone went off. Accusingly, I looked at my students but they all shook their heads. It turns out that it was my phone (it was my first cell phone and was newly acquired). My best friend called to tell me of the terrorist attacks in New York knowing that I had family there. That day I rolled a big old box TV into my classroom and played footage of the news all day. I told my students that this day they would remember for the rest of their lives. Many did not get the humanity of it then. I hope that they, looking back, do now.</p></div><div class="survey-result"><p class="survey-question">What is your favorite book? Why?</p><p class="survey-response">The Joy Luck Club by Amy Tan is my favorite book. That book destroys me every time - the way that female relationships are depicted so excruciatingly beautiful and difficult and true tears me apart. The sacrifices that the mothers make I could feel before I became a mother but now that I have children, I feel so much stronger how mothers will do anything for their children. Before I was the annoyed child, but to hear the words \"I see you!\" still does me in. We all just want to be seen and heard. And we want our loved ones to be safe.</p></div><div class="survey-result"><p class="survey-question">What is something that has been a struggle in your life?</p><p class="survey-response">Oh man - this is hard because I see other people struggle just to survive so my personal issues seem fluff. I think though, it is something that I have been witnessing personally. I would say that the biggest struggle that I have gone through is watching my mother struggle with mental illness and trauma. You could make a movie or write book based on her life and it would not be a feel good one. I did not know about any of her life trials until my early 20s as she hid it from us and wanted us to have a happy carefree childhood. My mother was born is Brooklyn in 1944. Her parents were separated but her father snuck into the hospital and wrapped her up in a newspaper to try to take her away. He was caught and she was returned. Her mother suffered from MS and they lived with my mother's grandparents. They were not happy that they were caretakers. My mother never felt wanted and I never heard her say that she felt loved. At 18 she married the first nice guy that asked as her grandfather would not allow her to move out with friends or go to college. That husband hit her after he brought home a STD that she asked about. She always felt controlled and threatened. She had two kids with him but was widowed at age 23. She met my father and saw a promise of an easier life. It did get better but her pain was never healed. When I was five, she took a lot of pills. It was a cry for help I think and she began therapy shortly afterwards. Her therapists were never good. They threw a lot of pills at her but never trulyl listened. I'm 42 now and she still isn't well - she has PTSD and I fear she will never be healed.</p></div><div class="survey-result"><p class="survey-question">What qualities does the U.S. House of Representatives possess that makes it unique as an institution?</p><p class="survey-response">Being a Representative by definition means that the people that vote for you entrust you to make the best decisions that effect their lives. A person with this position needs to listen to their people and stay in touch with their needs and struggles. A person needs to be accessible and not hide from criticism nor complaint. This position is unique as it should be the purest reflection of the voice of the people.</p></div><div class="survey-result"><p class="survey-question">Do you believe that it's beneficial for representatives to have previous experience in government or politics?</p><p class="survey-response">In the sense that a person understands rules and processes, it can be beneficial to have previous experience. But those things can be learned before serving and not having previous experience should not be a hindrance. What you do get with a political newcomer is fresh energy and insight free from the things that can corrupt like political alliances and bought-for allegiance.</p></div><div class="survey-result"><p class="survey-question">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p><p class="survey-response">The people as a nation need to rid themselves of the toxic political divide as that alone is inhibiting our progress. There is so much corrupting politics right now: Big Money, special interests, political egos, corporate/capitalistic interests over people/workers/environment - we are being divided so that we are weak. Once we can come together, we can address so many problems and make reforms across the board to improve the life, liberty, and happiness of all Americans. We need to realize that we do not live in our own bubble though too. We need to work with other nations to create a healthy world in regards to environmental threats, trade deals, and in keeping peace.</p></div><div class="survey-result"><p class="survey-question">If you are not a current representative, are there certain committees that you would want to be a part of?</p><p class="survey-response">I would be honored to serve on any committee and would give my all to learning and listening to experts on any issue. My first choice would be serving on the Education and Labor Committee as I feel my professional background and having a teacher's point of view will be highly beneficial to informing decisions made here.</p></div><div class="survey-result"><p class="survey-question">Do you believe that two years is the right term length for representatives?</p><p class="survey-response">I struggle with this as it was set as such in the Constitution. However the challenge that occurs is that you get one solid year of service which may be a lot of learning the job if it's the first term for a person. The second term is muddied with having to worry about campaigning again to win another term. Solutions to this predicament would be to lengthen the term to 3 years or even better, to reform campaign financing. If each candidate can only raise a certain equal amount or be given an equal stipend, then there would be less financial burden for candidates. That would also allow more people to run for office that were previously held back due to income obstacles.</p></div><div class="survey-result"><p class="survey-question">What are your thoughts on term limits?</p><p class="survey-response">I am 100% for them on every level. Term limits would help end corruption and allow for better representation of the people.</p></div><div class="survey-result"><p class="survey-question">Is there a particular representative, past or present, whom you want to model yourself after?</p><p class="survey-response">Past Representative Jeannette Rankin's work for Women's Rights stands out to me as she was elected at a time when women were not even allowed to vote and then went on to introduce legislation that would become the 19th Constitutional Amendment. I am watching a lot of the women that are new to Congress that have come from nontraditional backgrounds, but it is too soon to point to any specific person just yet. I admire that each ran for Congress and we're elected which demonstrates great bravery and personal strength.</p></div><div class="survey-result"><p class="survey-question">Both sitting representatives and candidates for office hear many personal stories from the residents of their district. Is there a story that you’ve heard that you found particularly touching, memorable, or impactful?</p><p class="survey-response">I have begun to travel across the eight counties of this district and my intentions is to listen and learn. Generally, people feel like their voice is not heard whether they live in the most populous portion of the district or the most remote. So far I have heard many touching stories but I will not use them as a political prop.</p></div></div><div class="text-center" style="padding-bottom:16px"><a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Jaime_Castle" data-cy="ballot-link-2" target="_blank"><div class="Body9-sc-1rnu18a-0 PolicyPositions__OpenSecretsLink-sc-1qls1o4-1 enpfsx">CANDIDATE DATA COURTESY OF BALLOTPEDIA</div></a><a href="mailto:info@thegoodparty.org?subject=Data%20Error:%20Candidate%20Page&body=http://localhost:45678/elections/candidate/house/jaime-castle/941"><div class="Body9-sc-1rnu18a-0 PolicyPositions__ReportError-sc-1qls1o4-0 gcddSB">Report an error</div></a></div></div></div><div data-cy="campaign-website"><div class="bold600 Body-oq66q5-0 dsBCot" style="margin:48px 0 16px">Campaign Website & Other Info</div><div class="Body13-sc-1v6ponj-0 bcPRzO"><h3>Healthcare</h3><p>The lack of quality healthcare choices at affordable prices is tearing away at the health and safety of American families, and I’ve seen this firsthand with many of my loved ones. We need to reform our current system to ensure that all citizens can be covered with the comprehensive plan that works for them. There are multiple paths to achieve this, but whatever we choose, it must keep and strengthen the protections for those with pre-existing conditions and it must be affordable for everyone. I will work tirelessly on these reforms to build the bridge to the future where universal coverage is the standard for care.</p><p>While we build to this future, we must not forget the struggles of those in rural communities, who may have to drive great distances to receive care. Also, we have to address the hidden suffering of individuals who need mental health services. It is crucial that we provide a safe environment for those citizens to seek the help that they need, and not feel confined to the shadows.</p><h3>Gun Violence</h3><p>The consequences of gun violence are shown to us day after day at an alarming rate. In 2017 nearly 40,000 people died from gun violence, more people than died in car accidents. Women in America are 21 times more likely to die from gun violence than in other comparable developed nations, and firearms are the second-leading cause of death amongst U.S. children (NEJM 2018). There are several concrete steps that Congress can take now that would keep guns out of the hands of legally restricted purchasers and remove guns from people showing threatening behavior. These actions are supported by majorities of Americans, regardless of political party, but are blocked by special interest groups. They include Universal Background Checks, which would require private gun sellers to use the same background check system currently used by licensed gun dealers, and expansion and implementation of Red Flag Laws that allow family members or law enforcement to petition a judge to temporarily remove guns from a person who is seen to be a risk to themselves or others. Currently only 17 states have some form of risk-based gun removal laws and strong majorities of Americans from across the political spectrum support these laws.</p><p>I have been in the classroom with children during school lockdown drills. I have comforted sobbing second graders clasping chapter books or pencils to be thrown as weapons to distract would be killers that prey on our innocents. We owe these children, I owe my children, action to help deter any harm. We can #DoSomething!</p><h3>Women’s Right to Choose</h3><p>Women’s health choices, and especially their reproductive choices, are some of the most personal and intimate decisions a person can make. Congress needs to empower women to make their own choices when it comes to what is right for them, in consultation with medical professionals. Additional resources must be allocated at the local level to ensure that comprehensive, age-appropriate sexual education is available to all. Further, it is long overdue to fix that birth control cannot be purchased as an over-the-counter medication. I will fight to make quality birth control options available for all who want it.</p><h3>Student Loan Reform</h3><p>The costs of higher education have been rising at a far higher rate than homes, utilities and even healthcare. This has put young people and their families in the position on taking on increasingly large amounts of debt to finance their dreams and ambitions.</p><p>Students must be allowed to refinance their existing loans to receive the same low interest rates that the biggest banks do when borrowing money. Corporations that benefit from an educated workforce should chip in more to both college and vocational education.</p><p>The existing public service loan repayment program must be streamlined so that graduates who choose a career in public service, including teachers, have the confidence that their debts will be forgiven after they complete the 10 years of work. It is shameful that currently under one percent of applicants in this program are ultimately granted relief. I also believe that we need to reform and expand existing government programs that will increase the amount of students graduating with degrees in mental healthcare and many other medical fields by offering some level of student loan forgiveness to help alleviate the giant student loan cost of obtaining these crucial to our communities skills and services.</p><h3>Environment</h3><p>Preserving our lands, air, and waterways is a key policy priority for me. In addition to ensuring our air and water is clean and safe, we can improve our economy with the right legislation. By utilizing the latest technology in energy production, we can make Ohio’s second district a hub for energy innovation. We can achieve this by shifting existing tax breaks away from the largest polluters and direct those funds into new innovative technologies. By doing this we can both lower the cost of power and spread well-paying jobs of the future throughout the second district.</p><h3>Opioid Crisis</h3><p>Southern Ohio has been ground zero for the opioid epidemic. As an educator I have seen firsthand the devastating effects that addiction has on individuals, families, and the broader community. I will fiercely advocate for increased funding for both prevention and rehabilitation measures, and I will hold accountable the prescription drug companies that have profited from this crisis.</p><h3>Job Development</h3><p>My career trajectory has crossed many fields. These have included teaching, being a successful entrepreneur, and being a stay at home mom. Something has remained true throughout my life and that is that I believe in the importance of dignity of work. This means valuing our existing workers and helping those who struggle to find jobs.</p><p>The government can help develop jobs by encouraging entrepreneurship by adjusting zoning codes (working with the local communities), helping to facilitate walkable business districts, simplifying local regulations for start-ups, and by offering resources to help businesses grow. Opening a business can be overwhelming with all of the codes and regulations to understand. We can make local laws easier to understand supporting a diverse crowd of small businesses and innovation.   Local economies have a lot to gain through job creation and income generation by empowering small businesses to succeed.</p><p>For far too long blue-collar work has been stigmatized and underpaid. We need to invest in job training programs to increase our workers’ skills and abilities. We also need to support workers’ ability to organize and bargain collectively in a global economy. I know that when Ohio’s workers are given a fair shot, we will always prove our worth. I look forward to traveling throughout our district to learn more from the people and to partner with them to help our communities succeed.</p></div><div class="text-center"><div
