Tell us about yourself.</strong></p><p>I am a little black girl who grew up on a pig farm in Southern Alabama. I grew up below the bottom rung of the economic ladder. I grew up in a home with no insulation, no running water, an outhouse in the back and a well on the side. I crawled my way from up under a rock to become the first in my family to go and finish college, I spent 10 years in the U.S. Armed Forces Reserves, I was accepted into Officer Candidacy School, worked with two major financial industry firms, worked in Corporate America, was an adjunct professor of Corporate Finance, spent the past four years on mainstream media defending our values, authored my first book, NOTHING TO LOSE, EVERYTHING TO GAIN: Being Black & Conservative in America, homeschooled my two children for the past six years, and now I'm running for Congress. My story only takes place in America. My story represents all that is good about this country. I love my country and I want to see every single person thrive. My entire life, even without realizing it, has prepared me for such a time as this...to represent the people of CD 04 and to be a voice of balance and reason. I believe my story represent the lives of so many Americans who have worked hard to achieve a measure of success. I am unapologetic for it. I want to see these opportunities preserved for the next little boy or girl who find themselves under a rock. </p><p><strong>Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?</strong></p><ul><li>I am running for Congress because as a wife, mother, veteran, and American, I want to secure and preserve my country for the next generation.</li><li>I am running for Congress because we can do better than the abject policy failures of my opponent and the Democrat Party. Our nation is in trouble. Mob rule and their knee jerk emotions now have a direct pipeline to the creation of laws and policies, which jeopardizes all of our liberties. Our "leaders" have been found lacking moral courage and a backbone. </li><li>China needs to pay for what they've done to our nation and the lives COVID-19 has ravaged. We need sensible infrastructure spending bills that is not heavy laden with political agendas, but works to create sustainable jobs.</li></ul><p><strong>What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</strong></p><p>I am personally passionate about all things that preserves America - law and order, reopening businesses, and creating economic opportunities for all. </p><p><strong>Is there a book, essay, film, or something else you would recommend to someone who wants to understand your political philosophy?</strong></p><p>Nothing to Lose, Everything to Gain: Being Black and Conservative in America, by Kathy Barnette Applied Economics: Thinking Beyond Stage One by Thomas Sowell The Federalist Papers, edited by Mary Webster Free to Choose, Milton Friedman</p><p><strong>What do you believe are the core responsibilities for someone elected to this office?</strong></p><p>The core responsibility for someone elected into the U.S. House of Representative is to represent the interests of their constituents first...always. Unfortunately, what our experience has often been is our elected officials going to Washington, D.C., getting well versed in Washington D.C.'s agenda and then coming back home to represent Washington D.C.'s interest to us. </p><p><strong>What legacy would you like to leave?</strong></p><p>The legacy I would like to leave for my children and this nation is that we all have a debt to repay to all those who have come before us. We have an obligation to live well in this nation. We stand on the shoulders of giants, whom we can only repay by living a worthy life.</p><p><strong>What are your thoughts on term limits?</strong></p><p>I support term limits. In fact, I am committed to only serving 2 terms in the U.S. House of Representatives. One of the many problems we have with our elected officials is that they get into office and die in office. I do not believe this is how our government was intended to operate. I will serve my country faithfully for no longer than 2 terms.</p><p><strong>Both sitting representatives and candidates for office hear many personal stories from the residents of their district. Is there a story that you’ve heard that you found particularly touching, memorable, or impactful?</strong></p><p>I hear stories on an almost daily basis from constituents who want to get back to work. COVID-19 is a serious virus, especially to those with a compromised immune system. While we must implement measures that continues to mitigate the spread of this virus, we cannot decimate people's ability to earn a living, provide for their families, and build towards their future. Unfortunately, because our political leaders have politicized the virus, good people don't know what is real and what is manipulation making it difficult for them to know what to do next. We need better leaders representing us. Their stories and tears have solidified just how much control our government have in almost every single decision we make. It has reinforced the need to make sure we have "good" legislators representing what's in our best interest.</p></div><div class="text-center" style="padding-bottom:16px"><a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Kathy_Barnette" data-cy="ballot-link-2" target="_blank"><div class="Body9-sc-1rnu18a-0 PolicyPositions__OpenSecretsLink-sc-1qls1o4-1 enpfsx">CANDIDATE DATA COURTESY OF BALLOTPEDIA</div></a><a href="mailto:info@thegoodparty.org?subject=Data%20Error:%20Candidate%20Page&body=http://localhost:45678/elections/candidate/house/kathy-barnette/1118"><div class="Body9-sc-1rnu18a-0 PolicyPositions__ReportError-sc-1qls1o4-0 gcddSB">Report an error</div></a></div></div></div><div data-cy="campaign-website"><div class="bold600 Body-oq66q5-0 dsBCot" style="margin:48px 0 16px">Campaign Website & Other Info</div><div class="Body13-sc-1v6ponj-0 bcPRzO"><h1><strong>Minority Inclusion Act (MIA)</strong> </h1><h3><strong>Reimagining the Black Community</strong></h3><p><strong>What’s often missing in action (MIA) in the board rooms and closed door meetings where the black community is discussed are black people, specifically black people who live in those communities.</strong></p><p><strong>Minority Inclusion Act (MIA)</strong> <strong>will work to ensure maximum community participation.</strong></p><p><strong>Every action we take moving forward must revolve around changing:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Access</strong></li><li><strong>Culture</strong></li><li><strong>Participation</strong></li><li><strong>Policy</strong></li></ul><p>PART 1:  COMMUNITY ACTION PROGRAM (CAP)</p><p> 1.  Community-driven change is the key</p><p>Grassroots efforts that are necessary to change the landscape of a community must come from within the community, not from an outside source.</p><p>What we are experiencing all across America are outside groups and forces coming into predominately black communities and telling those communities what their issues are and how to resolve them.</p><p>Those living in predominantly minority communities do not need to be told the issues.

We must take a holistic approach to addressing systemic issues in these communities.</p><p>Predominantly minority communities do not need a concerted federal effort to resolve the conditions they experience every day, encourage people within neighborhoods to form their own community action agencies.</p><p>They need support and to be empowered to take ownership and to have a personal stake in their community.</p><p>Organizations must be “autonomous and self-managed”</p><p>We must disrupt the local power structure to be more inclusive so that all can participate in America’s shared prosperity.</p><p>Unlike federal aid to education, which grants power and money to local school boards and then rely on them to do the right thing is distributing those funds, community action will circumvent municipal officials and local elites, directly empowering and funding the residents to rebuild their own neighborhoods.</p><p>We will require that community action agencies be developed, conducted, and administered with the maximum feasible participation of residents in the area – including the poor.</p><p>These communities need to be empowered, as well as receive financial assistance.</p><p>Traditional transfer programs must give way to community action projects that actively empowers the residents and involves them in managing their own communities.</p><p>We will work with the community to design and run local programs.</p><p>Residents, with the support of local officials, will form autonomous and self-managed organizations that will exert political influence on behalf of their own best interest.</p><p>Oversight of CAP should be a cabinet position.</p><p>Will force local officials to create access to local residents to actively participate in designing plans for their community.</p><p>As a result, these designs will be more responsive to minority problems.</p><p>Rebuilding all of America following “sanctioned” riots and looting</p><p>We must hold certain law officials accountable.</p><p>As the former U.S. National Security Advisor, Collin Powell, once replied, “Money, capital, is a coward; it will go nowhere where it is put in fear. Money will fly and go away from corruption and bad policies.”</p><p>In those cities where rioting and looting was given “space,” where previously passed Opportunity Zone legislation would have benefited the most will now be hurt the most.</p><p>More affluent areas will be assisted by the City to rebuild.</p><p>History tells us that may not be the case for poorer neighborhoods.</p><p><u>Specifically, where mayors called for law enforcement and law-abiding citizens to “give space” to rioters and looters, we will demand those cities commit to restoring poorer areas, as well as the more affluent areas.</u></p><p>Appropriations</p><p>A portion of State’s federal funds will be used to fund these programs.</p><p>See Attorney General’s budget.</p><ul><li>PART 2:  COMMUNITY ACTION PROGRAM (CAP)</li><li>While the 1863 Emancipation Proclamation gave more than 3 million black people freedom, the passage of the Civil Rights Act in 1964 put us on the path to equality. </li><li>Our path towards that equality has not always been a smooth one.

To enable small emerging businesses the opportunity to meet the goals of Financial Inclusion – Capital must flow.</p><p>All direct contracts with W/MBE Businesses will be on a two-week payment schedule.</p><p>Large or Non-W/MBE businesses who hire 35% or more of subcontractors will also be entitled to the two-week payment schedule and pass the payment promptly down to all lower tier vendors regardless of standing.</p><p>Contracts with the Federal Government must also include a failure to properly invoice by the prime contractor will not relieve said contractor from not keeping with the two-week payment schedule to lower tier subcontractors.</p><ol><li><u>Education inclusion</u></li></ol><p><u>All children have the right to a quality education.</u></p><p>But all too often they find themselves trapped in failing schools.</p><p>Fredrick Douglas said, “Knowledge makes a man unfit to be a slave” and we agree.</p><p>We will work to make school choice a reality for parents and students regardless of zip code</p><p>Schools need a level of accountability with an elected local committee of stakeholders at each school.</p><p>A large centralized School Board cannot adequately manage individual schools.</p><p>Decentralized school board systems within major cities.</p><p>Bring accountable to the local school.</p><p>Each township should have its own local and elected school board.</p><p><u>We will take action to ensure school choice for all children.</u></p><p>A child’s future shouldn’t be determined by their zip code.</p><p>We will work to empower disadvantaged and minority students with dual enrollment opportunities, improved career pathway programs, and additional relief for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU’s).</p><p>We will work to ensure incarcerated individuals have the opportunity to successfully rejoin and contribute to their communities through second chance Pell grants.</p><ol><li>We need to address the issues that hinder full inclusion into society head on.  We have had enough of the Liberal-pandering to the minority community.  Enough lip service.  We all want real change.  We want a seat at the table when the black community is being discussed.<br></li></ol><h1><strong>The CHINA PIVOT</strong></h1><h1><em><strong>The Chinese Mask has fallen off.  Their “true” face has been revealed. </strong></em> </h1><h1>The question is whether we have political leaders who will put American values above greed and HOLD CHINA ACCOUNTABLE?</h1><p><a href="https://www.inquirer.com/philly/blogs/inq-phillydeals/trump-china-trade-war-pa-congress-race-20181011.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FACT</a><a href="https://www.inquirer.com/philly/blogs/inq-phillydeals/trump-china-trade-war-pa-congress-race-20181011.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">: </a> During her 2018 campaign, Rep.
