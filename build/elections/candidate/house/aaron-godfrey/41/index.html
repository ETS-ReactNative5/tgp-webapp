Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p><p class="survey-response">I am a 33 year-old physicist, first-generation college graduate, and son of a working-class family. I believe the government should be working for the people, and I believe that it rarely does that anymore - that it has been captured by the donor class and the moneyed elite. I want to to go to DC to make it work for the people again: to help create a government that ensures all Americans have healthcare, a clean & protected environment, access to education - and much more. I want Ohio's 16th District to have a voice again - something they do not have with the incumbent.</p></div><div class="survey-result"><p class="survey-question">Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?</p><ul class="key-messages"><li>Healthcare is a human right, and it should be accessible and affordable to everyone in this country.</li><li>We must protect the environment so that our kids and grandkids can live in a world with clean air and water.</li><li>Everyone deserves an education that doesn't burden them with lifelong debt they can never escape.</li></ul></div><div class="survey-result"><p class="survey-question">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p><p class="survey-response">Healthcare, education, environment, science/tech, renewable energy, public transit, equality, LGBTQ+ protections, worker's rights, fair wages</p></div><div class="survey-result"><p class="survey-question">Who do you look up to? Whose example would you like to follow, and why?</p><p class="survey-response">I have at least three congressional heroes: Senators Sherrod Brown, Elizabeth Warren, and Bernie Sanders. As far as whose example I'd like to follow, I think it'd be both Sen. Brown and Sen. Warren: Sherrod, because he preaches a pragmatic progressivism that wins in Ohio and I think resonates with the American people as a whole (hence the push to get him to run for President). Sen. Warren, because she is a policy wonk who relies on experts, details, and logical solutions to issues facing this country (which, as a scientist, I certainly appreciate). I endeavor to follow the example set by all three to always fight for the people, to never take 'no' for an answer, and to never lose sight of who you work for, why, and going into work every day knowing you are there for one reason: to make people's lives better.</p></div><div class="survey-result"><p class="survey-question">Is there a book, essay, film, or something else you would recommend to someone who wants to understand your political philosophy?</p><p class="survey-response">I can't think of a single book or film or essay, but I'll say that I've always been a history buff, and I think that knowing the history of our nation can inform us a lot about where we are today and give us an idea on how to proceed in the future. A lot of these things from the last 200+ years are ingrained in our national psyche, so in my opinion, it always benefits to read a good book about our history! To that end, I recently finished \"Almost a Miracle\", by John E. Firling. It's an excellent book that covers the American Revolutionary War and how it was won, and how we came so close to losing it so many times. It's absolutely fascinating and a great read!</p></div><div class="survey-result"><p class="survey-question">What characteristics or principles are most important for an elected official?</p><p class="survey-response">Honesty, integrity, and incorruptibility. Stand for what you believe in, and don't buckle to malign forces. Tell it to the people straight, so they can be informed, and we can move forward together with clear eyes. Refuse to be bought, because the principles that guide your run for office are more important than money, fame, notoriety, etc. Work ethic. Do your job. You were put there for a reason. Act in good faith and work for the people who voted for you.</p></div><div class="survey-result"><p class="survey-question">What do you believe are the core responsibilities for someone elected to this office?</p><p class="survey-response">Represent the people, and work for them! You are their employee, not the President's, and you don't owe any President anything. Work for the people, not your ambitions, not your bank account, *the people*.</p></div><div class="survey-result"><p class="survey-question">What legacy would you like to leave?</p><p class="survey-response">I want to make this country a better place for everyone who lives here, but I especially want to make it a better place for people who have a disadvantaged beginning. I was born in a lower-middle class family, but as I grew up, our fortunes got worse and worse, and by the time I went to college, my dad had diabetes, we couldn't afford the treatment, and every semester was a struggle to find the money to pay for it - and as a result, I'll have a lifetime of debt I can never escape. I could go on, into my dad's story and my family history, but suffice to say: no one should have to choose between medicine and putting food on the table, no one should have to go into a lifetime of debt for an education, and this country in general needs to be made to work for the people instead of the corporations that buy Congress and dictate the legislation it writes right now. At the end of the day, though - if I make this country a better place for the working & middle class, if I make their healthcare in any way more accessible or more affordable, if I make it possible for every kid in the 16th and in this country as a whole to get the education they want without a lifetime of debt - then I will die a happy man.</p></div><div class="survey-result"><p class="survey-question">What is the first historical event that happened in your lifetime that you remember? How old were you at the time?</p><p class="survey-response">I was delivering newspapers during the Gore/Bush election in 2000 - Gore clearly winning, the SCOTUS giving the election to Bush - and being outraged (at 14 years old!) that \"hanging chads\" were a thing - the voter's intent was absolutely crystal clear! It seemed an awful abuse of power for everyone involved in that debacle to decide the election the way they did, and it still pains me to think about how much better the country - and world - would be, had the people's voices been heard in 2000, and Al Gore were sworn in in 2001.</p></div><div class="survey-result"><p class="survey-question">What was your very first job? How long did you have it?</p><p class="survey-response">My first job was at Midway Cinemas in Elyria, OH. I worked there in my senior year of high school, and worked there between semesters through my third year of undergraduate college. My first job in my field, post-college, was at Energizer Household Products, where I was a Senior Technologist. I was the sole full-time employee working in their renewable energy products. Unfortunately, I was laid off a year and a half after starting when they started significantly scaling back their operations - including R&D, where I worked.</p></div><div class="survey-result"><p class="survey-question">What is your favorite book? Why?</p><p class="survey-response">Guns, Germs, and Steel, by Jared Diamond. I highly recommend this book to anyone with any sort of interest in anthropology or the evolution of human societies. It's a fascinating look at how some civilizations wound up being dominant over others, and the role that technology played in that, and how where people settled wound up making a big difference, as it dictated things like the types of crops and livestock that were available for domestication. It's utterly fascinating, and I highly recommend it!</p></div><div class="survey-result"><p class="survey-question">What qualities does the U.S. House of Representatives possess that makes it unique as an institution?</p><p class="survey-response">The relatively small size of our constituency makes it easier for us to remain in contact with the people, and allow us to be more reflective of their will on the issues facing DC. And as Representative, I would do everything I could in order to maintain that connection with the people: I would hold town halls as frequently as possible when on recess, and allow remote participation (given the sprawling length of our district, this feels necessary!). Also, having the power of the purse - the right to set spending within the country - gives the US House immense power in determining the priorities set by the federal government. This means, as a Representative for Ohio's 16th District, I will be able to more accurately represent the will of the people in our district, while also having a say in budget appropriations that benefit our district.</p></div><div class="survey-result"><p class="survey-question">Do you believe that it's beneficial for representatives to have previous experience in government or politics?</p><p class="survey-response">Yes and no. For any job, I think it matters to hire people knowledgeable and experienced. But this job is a little different: the US house is supposed to represent the people, after all, and 60% of the people are not lawyers, with a majority of the remainders businessmen. So if we really want to have a dynamic and representative body as a whole, we need people from all walks of life - including scientists. It is important, however, to have a knowledge of the issues. And as someone who has been following politics my entire life, I have a deep understanding of many of the important issues facing our country, and ideas on how to address them. Furthermore, my experience as a scientists assures the voters and my future constituents that I not only believe in science, but would utilize any experts at my disposal when it comes to legislating, and that I would not discount science and scientists the way so many people in DC do today.</p></div><div class="survey-result"><p class="survey-question">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p><p class="survey-response">Corruption, plain and simple. Lobbyists and their grip on DC continue to dictate the issues heard in DC and the solutions proposed to those issues, while hyperpartisan Representatives in gerrymandered districts maintain a grip on power due to districts unfairly drawn. Until we deal with corruption - in all its forms - it will be hard to overcome any of the other issues facing the nation. Gerrymandering is a great example of this problem: when politicians get to draw their districts, they entrench partisanship and dilute the voice of the people: a problem we know all too well here in the 16th District. In office, I would work closely with other anti-corruption advocates, such as Sen. Warren, to pass legislation outlawing gerrymandering, limiting lobbyists, and beyond - to ensure our government works for people, not a bought Representative's corporate owners.</p></div><div class="survey-result"><p class="survey-question">If you are not a current representative, are there certain committees that you would want to be a part of?</p><p class="survey-response">I would like to be on the following committees: Agriculture; Education and Labor; Ethics; Science, Space, and Technology; Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions; Select Committee on the Climate Crisis; and Energy and Natural Resources. I think I could do my district a good deal of service on these committees specifically, particularly paired with my own expertise, but I will take advantage of any opportunity to represent my district in any committees that may offer me the role.</p></div><div class="survey-result"><p class="survey-question">Do you believe that two years is the right term length for representatives?</p><p class="survey-response">Yes. We need to remain accountable to the people. Current elected officials may gripe at having to campaign so often, but it forces us to stay honest.</p></div><div class="survey-result"><p class="survey-question">What are your thoughts on term limits?</p><p class="survey-response">I am against them. They favor those with a lot of resources to run for office, and those who want to run candidates who support their views. The ultimate term limit is the people's vote when it comes to the US House - hence the short terms in office. If we want to enforce 'term limits' for Representatives, the best course of action is to mandate fair districts so that Representatives that lose their connection to the people are voted out by the people, not by an arbitrary term limit decided by some other politician.</p></div><div class="survey-result"><p class="survey-question">If you are not currently a member of your party’s leadership in the U.S. House of Representatives, would you be interested in joining the leadership? If so, in what role?</p><p class="survey-response">Yes, but I suspect that would be years down the road. I would like to join the leadership in some form of an advisory role when it comes to issues relating to science, technology, energy, climate, the environment, and renewable energy.</p></div><div class="survey-result"><p class="survey-question">Is there a particular representative, past or present, whom you want to model yourself after?</p><p class="survey-response">Sen. Sherrod Brown was in the US House at one point - so I'll go for him, given all I said about him in a previous question.</p></div><div class="survey-result"><p class="survey-question">Both sitting representatives and candidates for office hear many personal stories from the residents of their district. Is there a story that you’ve heard that you found particularly touching, memorable, or impactful?</p><p class="survey-response">This probably sounds cliche, but I swear it's true: a while ago, a voter emailed me to tell me that they didn't have much, but they donated what they had left to my campaign - because they thought I was talking about the issues that mattered most, that I represented the change we needed in DC, and they believed in my candidacy. When I looked up the donation and saw the amount, the words from the email were hanging in the air. That it was the last of their money till payday, that they barely get by, but they thought it was worthy to give those few bucks to me. That stuck with me, and I still think about that person and that email today. I've been there, I've been where they are - were, hopefully - not knowing how you'll get to the next paycheck, not knowing if you have a job next week, not knowing if you'll even have a roof over your head in a month. This person's single email, and their small donation, has had a greater impact on me than a lot of what I've encountered on the trail. It was a moment that forced me to confront how big of a deal it is to run for office, to stand up for what you know is right, to try to give a voice to countless others who have walked in your footsteps and dealt with the same issues you are - to try and make this a government that works for people. I hope I can do them proud, and everyone else who has ever believed in a candidate before. This is for all of us.</p></div></div><div class="text-center" style="padding-bottom:16px"><a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Aaron_Godfrey" data-cy="ballot-link-2" target="_blank"><div
