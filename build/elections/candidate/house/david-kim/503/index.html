Occasionally this view aligns with a purely capitalist approach, whereby disparate entities vie for the best ideas. Yet there are a multitude of situations when a capitalist system results in unsatisfactory payoffs. One example of this would be when a pharmaceutical company charges exorbitant rates for a life-saving drug simply because their customers are desperate for the product.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ECurrently, the Market routinely manages to undervalue many of the people, activities and things which are essential to the human experience.

We should also direct capital to investments to boost human prosperity, instead of to enrich the wealthiest Americans.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, we need to curb corporate excesses by designating regulators who are paid salaries commensurate with senior positions in the private sector and prevented from going to the private industry afterward.

Tell us about yourself.</strong></p><p>My name is David Kim, and I'm a committed, courageous and trusting leader. I am a 2nd generation Asian American who currently works as a music attorney in the film industry, while serving as a Board Member on the MacArthur Park Neighborhood Council. And my goal is to achieve financial freedom for every American as it doesn't make sense for us to have 2-3 jobs just to make ends meet. And that's why I'm running for Congress: to provide a Universal Basic Income of 1K/month, to provide free Universal Medicare, to provide free public college and higher education, to cancel student debt on a one-time basis and to ban politicians like our current Congressman (Jimmy Gomez) from accepting and pocketing corporate donations. Additionally, we need to fight Climate Change and implement BIG policies for change, in implementing a Green New Deal and infrastructure to save our planet, country and people, abolish ICE, establish a US Citizenship Track Program for Undocumented Workers, Mass Decarceration, Gun Control and more.</p><p><strong>Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign.

It’s been talked about in America since the time that our country was founded: from Thomas Payne to Martin Luther King, Jr., and more recently, with Barack Obama, Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk and recent Democratic Presidential Candidate, Andrew Yang, who played an instrumental role in bringing Universal Basic Income back into the national conversation, since it was last discussed and passed in the U.S. House of Representatives in the early 1970s.</p><p>Putting universal basic income back into the national conversation helped pave the way to having Congress consider different ways of providing direct cash relief to Americans during the COVID19 quarantine. Although Congress fell short by only providing certain Americans a one-time $1200 stimulus check, universal basic income is gaining more support around the country and in DC, and it’s imperative that we elect a representative who will champion a universal basic income for all Americans, where our human value is not tied to the economic work value.</p><h3><strong>Why We Need It</strong></h3><p><strong>The main reasons for providing a Universal Basic Income of $1,000/month to every American are as follows:</strong></p><ol><li>The robot apocalypse, which has already started, will severely affect our working class, with technological automation and mass layoffs to occur in the next 12 years and with 1 out of 3 Americans losing their jobs to automation and unlike previous waves of automation, this time, new jobs will not appear quickly enough in large numbers to make up for it;</li><li>Today, we have the most tragic income disparity in our country’s recent history, with the working class, middle class and top 1% of our country’s income earners;</li><li>Three decades of wage stagnation and decreasing purchasing power of the American people; and</li><li>The decreasing rate of unionization (i.e., 1970s: 1 in 3 workers were unionized; Now: 1 in 20).</li></ol><p>What’s clear is that the current system simply isn’t working.</p><p>We now have 1 out of every 7 Americans living in poverty.</p><p>We now have 20% of our children living in poverty.</p><p>We now have a working class where their purchasing power is less than or equal to what it was 30 years ago.</p><p>We now have the bottom half of all American income earners making up 11% of the total income of all American income earners, less than the 20% it had been making 30 years ago.</p><p>We have the top 1% of all American income earners making 20% of the total income of all American income earners, more than what it had made 30 years ago, at 11%.</p><p>We now have districts like ours where the average monthly rent for a 1 bedroom apartment unit is at least over $2,000 a month and where the average annual income for a family of 4 is $38,000 a year.</p><p>Something’s wrong and this recent COVID19 pandemic and quarantine has made things worse. Now it’s time for us to do something about this.</p><h3><strong>What We Are Fighting For</strong></h3><p>That is why I am fighting for a Universal Basic Income of $1,000/month for every American adult and $500/month for every American child.</p><p>Providing our U.S. citizens $1,000/month would be a powerful tool to eliminate deprivation and would push at least 41 million Americans living below the poverty line, up and above it.</p><h3><strong>What It Will Do</strong></h3><p>Many of our Americans wouldn’t have to worry about economic reasons preventing them from leaving their abusive partners.</p><p>Sudden job losses or the car breaking down or a family member getting sick and having to visit the hospital would be less catastrophic as many of our American families and individuals are dollars and pennies away from not being able to make their daily ends meet.</p><p>With consistent, unconditional cash to cover their expenses, our American families and individuals will be able to be more selective about the working conditions they’re willing to accept, without being exploited time after time again.</p><p>Our homemaker wives, husbands and partners at home raising the children would now finally be recognized for the economic value of their work.</p><p>Our entrepreneurs would now be able to have some leeway to save up and/or go back to school on the side or start a small business and new venture.</p><p>Our families would now be able to care for their sick relatives without being restricted because of limited finances.</p><p>With a “trickle up” economy, with our American people now being able to pump money back into our economy, our economy would grow by 12.56 to 13.10% – or about $2.5 trillion by 2025 – and our labor force would increase by 4.5 – 4.7 million people.</p><p>These are just a few of the many benefits providing a Universal Basic Income to every American would do.</p><h2><strong>Medicare for All</strong></h2><p>Healthcare is a human right. With millions of Americans lacking any sort of  health insurance, it’s time our government steps in to protect our right to life. Through Medicare for All, we’ll guarantee health insurance for every citizen, permanent resident, and taxpayer. We’ll ensure quality healthcare and eliminate co-pays, surprise bills, and deductibles.</p><p>While the incumbent accepts money from major insurance companies, we listen to you. The majority of Americans support Medicare for All. <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2020/04/01/medicare-for-all-coronavirus-pandemic/">[1]</a> It’s not a part of a radical socialist agenda, it’s a lifesaving policy supported by most Americans.</p><p>Before the COVID-19 pandemic, over 27 million Americans lacked health insurance.<a href="https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2019/demo/p60-267.html"> [2]</a> In the 11 weeks leading up to June 4th, 40 million Americans have filed for unemployment and out of those, many have lost their health insurance coverage as well. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/04/economy/unemployment-benefits-coronavirus/index.html">[3]</a> America is the world’s wealthiest nation and this is completely unacceptable. The tragedy is only exacerbated by the insurance industry, which not only profits off of our suffering, it funds campaigns and lobbies policymakers in order to maintain its power.</p><p>That power hurts Americans. Healthcare-related debt is the largest cause of family bankruptcy in the nation. In 2009, Harvard Medical School found that almost 45,000 Americans died because of a lack of health coverage. Health insurance policy isn’t about ideology or party. It’s about saving lives. It’s time our government protects the interests of the people. It’s time we enact Medicare for All.</p><h3><strong>What We Are Fighting For </strong></h3><p>We’re fighting for Medicare for All: a single-payer national health insurance program that will guarantee healthcare for every American. With coverage that’s free at the point of care, we’ll eliminate premiums, deductibles, co-pays, and surprise bills. We’ll include vision, dental, in and out-patient care, reproductive and maternity care and prescription drugs to ensure that Americans are never limited in their healthcare access.</p><p>Modern problems require modern solutions. We’ll expand care to include mental health and substance abuse treatment, trauma and marriage counseling, and mindfulness counseling. </p><p>It’s not enough just to treat disease. We must prevent it. By empowering the Environmental Protection Agency and the Food and Drug Administration, we’ll prohibit environmental and agricultural policies that damage Americans’ health. </p><p>We’ll lower prescription drug prices by empowering Medicare to negotiate with major pharmaceutical companies and enabling patients and providers to purchase low-cost prescription drugs from other nations. Through the Prescription Drug Price Relief Act, we’ll halve prescription drug prices by pegging costs to median prices in five other major nations.</p><h3><strong>What It Will Do</strong></h3><p>By stepping up and caring for our people in the most basic areas, like health, we will unleash the power and spirit of the American people from their daily struggles of anxiety, sickness, scare, and medical debt. People will take less time off work and have more money in their pockets. Other issues—like mass incarceration, homelessness, and more—will also be alleviated once people are getting the mental and physical healthcare they need.</p><p>We will spend more on doctors, nurses, mental health specialists, dentists, and other professionals who provide services to people and improve their lives. We’ll invest in the development of new drugs and technologies that cure disease and alleviate pain—and not waste hundreds of billions of dollars a year on profiteering, huge executive compensation packages, and outrageous administrative costs. Said one billing representative: “The law allows us to charge whatever we want. If we want to charge a million dollars, she has to pay it.” Makary, M. <em>The Price We Pay: What Broke American Healthcare and How to Fix It.</em> Bloomsbury Publishing, 2019. It’s time to change the laws.</p><h2><strong>Green New Deal</strong></h2><p>Now, more than ever, our country needs to transition to a carbon-free, 100% renewable energy system and a fully modernized electrical grid, so that we can be 100% free of fossil fuels by 2030. Otherwise, it will be too late. We have already seen refugees fleeing extreme weather disasters, causing human calamities, unrest and conflict. We already have severe land erosion caused by rising sea levels. We have already experienced global warming that has increased exponentially over the years and continues to worsen at a frightening pace.</p><p>Rapid, man-made climate change and global warming represent a clear and PRESENT danger to our people, our democracy and the world at large. This is the single biggest national security threat for our country and the single biggest threat to worldwide industrialized civilization. To top that off, the effects of warming can be self-reinforcing and hard to predict. As such, we must be even more vigilant than ever. Our country must be a leader on the actions we take locally and globally — that means avoiding a worldwide refugee crisis by waging a war for climate justice through the mobilization of our people and our government.</p><h3><strong>Why We Need It</strong></h3><p>Right now, the economy is controlled by big corporations whose profits are dependent on the continuation of climate change. Only benefiting the very few and rich at the top, this unfortunate reality comes at the huge detriment of our planet and all of its inhabitants. The effects are life-threatening, be it constant erosion of our lands, rising sea levels, ocean acidification, heat waves, extreme weather events, and the list goes on. Yet, even worse than doing nothing, the current administration is actively rolling back the modest protections we do have, exacerbating the issue exponentially and putting more lives at risk all around the globe. How can the government help reverse climate change when its own politicians are pocketing money from big fossil fuel companies? And this is why we need to rise and speak up.</p><p>The fact that we are continuously relying on fossil fuels – coal, oil and natural gas – is holding us back from a new, clean energy revolution that would GREATLY benefit our economy, environment and collective public health. Fossil fuel companies have polluted our air and water, damaged our health, accelerated global warming, and tainted our political system for far too long. This must all stop, including the energy industry’s lobbying and contributions to political campaigns, both concerning the government and its elected officials; otherwise, the federal government will continue supporting the use of fossil fuels, handing out massive tax breaks and subsidies to multinational corporations that are already among the most profitable in the world.</p><p>U.S. fossil fuel-producing companies rake in hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue every year, with huge profit margins, yet the U.S. ranks the worst of all G7 countries by subsidizing fossil fuels the most — to the tune of over $26 billion a year.</p><p>Corruption, both legalized and unvarnished, makes it extremely difficult to take on the power of the energy-producing giants. And until we deal with the issue of money’s powerful influence on our political system, none of this will truly change. This is why campaign finance reform is something SO CRUCIALLY NEEDED and ESSENTIAL for a rebirth, and reshaping, of a more free, democratic and inclusive America — where human beings are more valued than short-term profits and corporate interests. Additionally, radically addressing climate change is a potential path towards a more equitable economy with increased employment and widespread financial security for all, as there is most definitely a relationship between economic stability and environmental sustainability. For these reasons, it’s important that we shift course and implement a Green New Deal – a transformation that implements structural changes to our political and financial systems, in order to help alter the trajectory of our environment.</p><h3><strong>What We Are Fighting For</strong></h3><p>We need to transform our energy system to 100% renewable energy and create 20 million jobs to solve the climate crisis, while ensuring a just transition for communities and individuals, including fossil fuel workers. We also need to ensure justice for frontline communities, especially under-resourced groups, communities of color, Native Americans, people with disabilities, children and the elderly. Additionally, we need to invest in weatherization, public transportation, modern infrastructure and high-speed broadband for all of our people, families and communities so that no one is left behind. Further, a commitment to reducing emissions throughout the world, while also rejoining the Paris Agreement, is needed as well.</p><p>While holding temperature increases as close as possible to where they are now is advisable, we can do more and reverse global warming back to more long-term sustainable levels.</p><p>That means taking our carbon that we have added to the atmosphere and putting it back into the earth from where it came, be it through reforestation, transforming our soil to farmland soil, restoring wetlands and peatlands, as well as increasing phytoplankton and fisheries, at the very minimum. Other measures include reducing food waste, promoting a plant-rich diet, protecting tropical forests, proper land management, regenerative agriculture, refrigerant management, encouraging the electrification of vehicles, sustainable home heating, distributed rooftop solar generation and the conversion of the power grid to zero-emissions energy sources. Even seemingly unrelated issues like educating all peoples globally and family planning are known to be an important part of the solution. And it is this type of full systems approach that we will need to reverse global warming and lead our planet towards long-term sustainability, for our generation and for future generations. Or else it will be too late.</p><p>The greed of the fossil fuel industry must be stopped and it must be held accountable.</p><h3><strong>What It Will Do</strong></h3><p>A Green New Deal would provide an overall strategy for how clean energy, sustainable infrastructure and transportation, as well as a national green jobs program could save our environment, reverse climate change, and revitalize our economy by utilizing our innovative human capacity to benefit all our people. This would ensure that many generations to come could continue living in a healthy and safe environment, without having to worry about harmful effects on their health, families and communities.</p><h2><strong>Clean Campaign Finance</strong></h2><p>Elections ought to voice the will of the people. Each person’s vote should count equally and voices shouldn’t be drowned out by big corporations and special interests. But in the 2018 election cycle, a minute proportion, <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/overview/donordemographics.php">.47%, of Americans</a> gave more than $200 in campaign contributions. Their influence was massive, accounting for 71% of all contributions. In that cycle, super PACs, which can raise and spend unlimited funds, <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/outsidespending/summ.php?cycle=2018&chrt=V&disp=O&type=S">raised over $1.5 billion</a>. With industries and elites working to elect candidates who will protect their interests, our campaign finance system doesn’t just cede power to corporations, it subverts our democracy, allowing candidates who raise the most money from corporate interests to win, often at the cost of more qualified and promising leaders.</p><h3><strong>Why We Need It</strong></h3><p>In the 2018 election, the insurance industry used political action committees (PACs) to funnel <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/industry.php?txt=F09&cycle=2018">over $28.5 million</a> worth of support to candidates across the nation, like my opponent, a corporately-funded incumbent, whose corporate/PAC donations make up 98.8% of his total campaign donations. It’s no wonder that insurance reform faces major opposition in Congress despite broad public support. Across every issue, special interests, enabled by campaign finance policy, shape elections.</p><p>From defense technology, with Lockheed Martin, Northrup Gruman, and Boeing PACs contributing a <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/industry.php?txt=D01&cycle=2018">combined $7 million</a>, to oil and gas, where corporate PACs <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/industry.php?txt=E01&cycle=2020">contributed $7.2</a> million, large corporations’ massive influence impacts decision-making in Washington. A <a href="http://www.gpprspring.com/mo-money-mo-votes-does-special-interest-money-affect-senators-voting-proclivities-on-climate-change">2019 Georgetown study</a> on donors and climate change found that political donations had significant influence on senators’ votes on climate issues. Our government is nothing more than a legalized system of bribery. The recent Covid-19 stimulus packages featured massive corporate bailouts, benefiting some of the same companies that helped fund and elect policymakers, perpetuating a cycle of reciprocity that silences the average American.</p><p>In our district, banks, developers, large insurance corporations, pharmaceutical companies, student debt collectors, and the military industrial complex <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/members-of-congress/summary?cid=N00040597">help to fund</a> the incumbent’s campaign. But our message is unfiltered by the interests of industries and special interests because we don’t accept any PAC contributions. It’s time every candidate follows the same democratic principles we do.</p><h3><strong>What We Are Fighting For</strong></h3><p>We’re fighting for campaign finance reform that eliminates the undue influence of corporations and super PACs. We will work to:</p><ul><li>Increase transparency of political donations by requiring all political nonprofits to disclose all donors</li><li>Implement the Democracy Dollars program, which will dilute the impact of corporate money in politics by providing every voter with $100 in publicly-funded campaign contribution vouchers per election cycle. In Seattle, a similar program <a href="http://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/EthicsElections/DemocracyVoucher/UW_Seattle_Voucher_Final.pdf">has increased</a> low-income voter  participation in the campaign finance system, and even in its first year, increased Seattle resident contributions <a href="http://www.seattle.gov/democracyvoucher/program-data/internal-program-reports">by 300%</a>. Nationally, each American voter using a $100 campaign contribution voucher would wash out lobbyist spending by seven to one. In our district alone, Democracy Dollars would provide $3.5 million per election cycle if only half the residents used their voucher—drowning out the money supplied by special interest groups.</li><li>Overturn Citizens United v. FEC, which allows unlimited political spending by corporations and empowers super PACs.</li></ul><h3><strong>What It Will Do</strong></h3><p>Campaign finance reform will amplify the voice of the people. When large corporations and super PACs can no longer interfere in our electoral process, elections will be decided by ballots, not banks. When campaigns, from state offices to the presidency, are driven by regular Americans, not the .47% who can afford to donate large amounts every year, we’ll achieve more responsive, more representative government. And with a truly democratic system, we’ll realize policies that make the world a better place for all.</p><h2><strong>Human-Centered Economy</strong></h2><p>The real threat to our individual liberties comes not from government but rather the “heedless self interest” of those in positions of vast wealth and power, whose greed crushed individual initiative and so restricted the “field open for free business” that private enterprise “became too private … it became privileged enterprise, not free enterprise.” – President Franklin D. Roosevelt</p><p>Corporations once had a duty of loyalty to the communities they were in. Now, their only duty is to make the most money for their shareholders, even if it may come at the expense of their employees, the surrounding communities and the general welfare of the American people.</p><p>The prevalent emphasis on corporate profits and short-term maximization of profits just isn’t working for a great majority of Americans. This unfortunate situation will only be exacerbated by the onset of automation and AI technology.</p><h3><strong>Why We Need It</strong></h3><p>Today, we have masses of people working 2-3 jobs just to make ends meet while our government has done nothing to address the ever-increasing 30+ year income and wealth gaps in our country. In times of high unemployment and economic distress, our government must take steps to restore the balance of economic opportunity in our free market economy.</p><p>And just like how President Franklin D. Roosevelt said that “democracy is not safe if the people tolerate the growth of private power to a point where it becomes stronger than their democratic state itself,” our country has now come to this point that he warned about. In such a system, the political equality of the people becomes meaningless in the face of economic inequality as life and liberty are no longer real and the people can no longer follow the pursuit of happiness in their own way, because they have no economic power.</p><p>Thus, we need to restore individual liberty as well as make the economy and free market work in such a way as to ensure equal economic opportunity for all Americans, not just the privileged few at the top. For a strong, vibrant economy isn’t possible without the peoples’ purchasing power and we need to correct such injustices and inequalities as they arise.</p><h3><strong>What We Are Fighting For</strong></h3><p>Accordingly, it’s time we transitioned to a new type of economy, a Human-Centered Economy, which aims to expand human well-being and fulfillment. A Human-Centered Economy has several central tenets:</p><ul><li>Human beings are more significant than money</li><li>The unit of a Human-Centered Economy is each person, not each dollar</li><li>Markets exist to serve our common goals and values</li><li>Ensuring that all human beings have the opportunity to work jobs with living wages</li></ul><p>Augmenting human welfare should be the primary focus of our economy, yet that is decidedly not the case. Occasionally this view aligns with a purely capitalist approach, whereby disparate entities vie for the best ideas. Yet there are a multitude of situations when a capitalist system results in unsatisfactory payoffs. One example of this would be when a pharmaceutical company charges exorbitant rates for a life-saving drug simply because their customers are desperate for the product.</p><p>Currently, the Market routinely manages to undervalue many of the people, activities and things which are essential to the human experience. With equality and well-being as guiding principles, we should leverage a Human-Centered Economy to make the economy work for the American people, rather than the other way around. The aim will be to generate measurements encompassing people, not dollars. We should also direct capital to investments to boost human prosperity, instead of to enrich the wealthiest Americans.</p><p>Additionally, we need to curb corporate excesses by designating regulators who are paid salaries commensurate with senior positions in the private sector and prevented from going to the private industry afterward. Regulators should have their sights set on making the right decisions and policies for the American public, with no concern for their next position clouding their judgement.</p><p>Further, we need to alter the way we evaluate the economy <em>—</em> from the stock market and GDP to a more all-encompassing set of measurements that ensures human beings are flourishing, not just merely scraping by. Novel measurements such as Childhood Success Rates, Mental Health, Median Income and Standard of Living, Health-adjusted Life Expectancy, Social and Economic Mobility, Absence of Substance Abuse, and others will provide us with a better, more substantial sense of just how we’re doing, both individually and as a society.</p><p>And lastly, we need to discover fresh ways to raise the standards of living for individual people and families. To prompt development, our government should issue a new type of currency called the Digital Social Credit. This can be turned into dollars and utilized to reward people and organizations which propel notable social value. With this new currency, the American people would be able to calculate the amount of good they have achieved through various programs and actions.</p><h3><strong>What It Will Do</strong></h3><p>A Human-Centered Economy allows us to reshape how we measure progress and value, helping us reconceive why we do what we do. The time has come to build an economy that actually makes our lives better and a Human-Centered Economy will help us do just that.</p><h2><strong>Homes Guarantee</strong></h2><p>We need to pass <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/4351">HR 4351</a>, and S 1919 (YIMBY Act).</p><p><strong>And then, we need to pass a Homes Guarantee that will:</strong> </p><ul><li>Build 12 million social housing units and eradicate homelessness</li><li>Reinvest in existing public housing</li><li>Protect renters and bank tenants</li><li>Pay reparations for centuries of racist housing policies</li><li>End land/real estate speculation and de-commodify housing</li></ul><p>Fully realized, these initiatives would guarantee homes for all.

When you do the math, you wonder how a family of four could live with this kind of income. They can’t.</p><p>So, many of them live with another family in the same unit; live on debt, with credit cards and loans; work 2-3 jobs; move out of town and/or struggle until they end up getting evicted and then experience homelessness.</p><p>And it’s not just because of housing that we experience this all, but also due to greater systemic issues of all sorts interplaying with each other. However, housing is certainly one area in which we can make significant positive change in social justice and equality for all; more specifically, housing for all, because housing is indeed a human right – no human being or American should ever have to worry day in and day out about whether they’ll be able to eat, have a roof to sleep under, have access to good healthcare and education, or be able to pay for their basic living expenses and costs. Human value comes before economic value, and we should ensure that every American is able to have access to affordable housing.</p><p>Most low-income households pay more than <a href="https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/most-lower-income-households-pay-more-half-their-income-housing">half of their income on rent</a>. This is wrong.</p><p>21 million households, disproportionately people of color, spend <a href="https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/state-nations-housing-2019">over 30% of their income</a> on housing. This is wrong.</p><p>Only <a href="https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/95616/case_for_more_not_less.pdf">1 in 5 households</a> that qualify for federal housing assistance actually receives it. This is wrong.</p><p>We need to care for our people and ensure that all have the equal ability to pursue a happy life. This starts with directly addressing and responding to America’s systemic, racialized housing emergency.</p><p>Additionally, with a shortage of 500,000+ units for low income renters in <a href="https://la.curbed.com/2019/6/25/18659812/affordable-housing-los-angeles-covenants-expire">Los Angeles county alone</a> and underproduced housing of 7.3 million homes from 2000 to 2015 federally, per Up for Growth’s <a href="https://www.upforgrowth.org/new-report-indicates-housing-shortage-more-severe-once-thought"><em>Housing Underproduction in the U.S.</em> report</a> (HR 4351 YIMBY Act), we are in a housing crisis. And we aren’t even talking about the 3 million people experiencing homelessness in our country, or the 7,000 unhoused brothers and sisters on Skid Row in our district, or the 60,000+ unhoused neighbors living in LA County.</p><p>Even with the public housing that our country does have, existing public housing units require over $70 billion for physical improvements to account for dilapidation and poor conditions, with 66% of public housing residents being people of color. While in Los Angeles, we have less than 10,000 units available compared to counties like New York, which has over 175,000 public housing units. This utter failure to fully address these issues drives racialized housing inequality and institutionalizes racism for many more years to come. The time for change is long overdue.</p><h3><strong>What We Are Fighting For</strong></h3><p>Firstly, passing a Homes Guarantee would mean that we would be able to build 12 million new social housing units over the next 10 years with the goal of providing homes to the nearly 12 million renter households who are currently extremely cost burdened (paying over 50% of their income to rent) and to the millions experiencing homelessness. Rent would be charged according to real costs-based or income-based formulas (i.e., no more than 30% of one’s income), and as social housing would be permanently off the private market, we would eliminate the profiteering and short-term maximization of profits that come at the expense of the people.</p><p>Secondly, a Homes Guarantee would allow us to recommit to public housing, beginning with repealing the Faircloth Amendment — which prohibits new public housing construction — as well as a multi-billion dollar reinvestment in pubic housing where it currently exists.</p><p>Thirdly, a Homes Guarantee would pass a national tenant bill of rights that is needed to protect tenants all across the country and especially during times like the recent COVID-19 pandemic, in which many of our people have suffered to a catastrophic degree.</p><p>Fourthly, a Homes Guarantee would pay reparations for centuries of racist land and housing policies.</p><p>Fifthly, a Homes Guarantee would end land and real estate speculation while also serving to de-commodify housing.</p><p>For more info on the Homes Guarantee plan, click <a href="https://homesguarantee.com/wp-content/uploads/Homes-Guarantee-_-Briefing-Book.pdf">here</a>.</p><h3><strong>What It Will Do</strong></h3><p>A Homes Guarantee will provide a roof over everyone’s head, improve education, health and employment prospects for tens of millions of people, and will provide a meaningful step in equalizing disparities across racial lines. A Homes Guarantee will also play a critical role in the environment and reversing climate change, as every housing intervention within the Homes Guarantee must also be a climate intervention, be it from upgrading the existing building stock and making it carbon neutral, or ensuring that everyone has equal, sufficient access to efficient and affordable energy in their homes, not disadvantaging any community or group of people because of their race or socio-economic status.</p><p>In the world’s wealthiest country, we can and we must guarantee safe, accessible, sustainable and permanently affordable housing for everyone. – HomesGuarantee.com, People’s Action</p><h2><strong>Ending Homelessness</strong></h2><p>There are hundreds of factors that contribute to homelessness, including a lack of affordable housing, a 30+ year income/wealth gap and wage stagnation, a dearth of legal tenant protections, racist housing policies, insufficient care in the mental and emotional health of our people, and more. If we don’t do anything in addressing many of these contributing factors and instead, continue to move on in life as if nothing “bad” is going on, eventually a plurality of the American people will end up experiencing homelessness and we’ll have a majority of the American people living in utter poverty.</p><p>30+ years ago, Americans used to receive pensions, which made up one of three retirement pillars for Americans, along with social security and one’s own personal savings. After pensions virtually disappeared, our people were left to fend for themselves, with only a chipped away social security and non-existent savings remaining due to 30+ year wage stagnation and the common struggle of making ends meet. This is the dire financial reality facing masses of people in our country. It’s time that we care for our people and ensure that no one has to suffer by experiencing homelessness, nor worry that they will at some point in their life. This starts with caring for our brothers and sisters who are currently experiencing homelessness.</p><h3><strong>Why We Need It</strong></h3><p>Today, we have 7,000 unhoused brothers and sisters living in Skid Row, of our district, while we have 60,000+ in Los Angeles County. Nationally, we have around 3 million families and individuals experiencing homelessness. And in a country like ours, founded upon freedom, truth and the pursuit of happiness for all, one of our primary focuses for the next Congress should be eradicating poverty and ending homelessness. No one should ever have to live on the streets without a physical home, nor worry about having to pick that option due to their circumstances in life. If we truly love our people, our priority should be ensuring that everyone has a roof to sleep under, no matter who they are.</p><h3><strong>What We Are Fighting For</strong></h3><p>Firstly, we need to de-criminalize homelessness federally. Plain and simple. You can’t be charged with a crime of being homeless, whether that be sleeping in your car or sleeping outside. We can do this while still addressing the concerns and interests of landlords as well as business owners.</p><p>Secondly, we need to give direct cash relief to all of our people, not leaving anyone out, for this is precisely how we lift people out of poverty. By laying this floor for everyone to be on, people are able to have some money to contribute towards rent and basic expenses. See the “Universal Basic Income” page for more information and related FAQs.</p><p>Thirdly, we need to provide Permanent Supportive Housing (PSH), following the “Housing First” model, an invention that combines affordable housing assistance with free, voluntary onsite wraparound support services to address the needs of people experiencing chronic homelessness (i.e., medical/dental assistance, trauma counseling, mindfulness training, domestic violence counseling, drug addiction recovery and therapy programs, etc.). This would empower residents and connect them with community-based healthcare and employment services. This scaled investment in PSH is a moral necessity and an essential step along the path to eradicating homelessness. We can do this by identifying and utilizing local buildings and properties that are vacant or abandoned, converting them to PSH use. And for those who are currently experiencing homelessness, they can use their above-referenced universal basic income as payment towards rent in the PSH. See the “Homes Guarantee” page for more.</p><p>Fourthly, while ensuring that such legislation like HR 4351 YIMBY Act and a Homes Guarantee are passed, we need to think of other ways to collaborate with local, state and federal governments. Whether it’s building more modular, portable units at a fraction of the current costs, utilizing unused school buildings and land for housing, or eliminating more exclusionary zoning laws that would restrict or limit the various options of affordable housing (be it ADUs, multi-dwelling units, collectivized living arrangements and more), all will be useful in helping to combat the complex challenges of the homelessness crisis.</p><p>Fifthly, we must provide more transitional living programs for our foster children. These programs would teach our youth how to budget, build a credit score, train and look for a job, learn how to mindfully use their universal basic income payments, as well as receive therapy counseling and mindfulness tools. We must also communicate to our communities that we have a moral responsibility to make sure our youth have safe families to live with. Between 30-50% of foster parents drop out of fostering each year while the number of children in foster care has increased to more than 440,000 today. And no longer is foster care assured to be a temporary, safe place for children anymore – more and more foster youth are falling into homelessness. We must provide for all of our youth, for we are all one human race and, sometimes, we forget this.</p><p>Further, we must ensure that in addition to passing minimum federal rent control standards and a basic bill of tenant rights, we establish that every person has a right to counsel in any eviction related matter, for this is how we make certain that no one is suddenly left to live on the streets without going through any due process.</p><p>And lastly, we must ban politicians and elected officials, like the current incumbent, from accepting money and donations from corporate interests, including developers. This is IMPERATIVE. Otherwise, every industry will continue to be negatively affected and harm the general welfare, health and interests of our people, be it in food, housing, chemicals, education, healthcare, and etc.</p><h3><strong>What It Will Do</strong></h3><p>Ending homelessness in America would save public money by reducing hospital and psychiatric admissions as well as incarceration, all of which are avoidable through a humane policy of housing and supporting people who need it. Ending homelessness would take our country and people to the next level of humanity. Because once we start caring for ALL of our peoples, ensuring that no one is left behind, the more united and one we become as a people and nation — and the more engaged all of us become in making life happen for us, and not to us.</p><h2><strong>Make Education Accessible to All</strong></h2><p>Even though our children are citizens of the United States, because they are under eighteen and cannot vote, they lack any representation in our government. And because they do not work, they lack financial leverage as well. Our children are not fully empowered United States citizens, and thus it is our collective responsibility to ensure their full rights.</p><p><strong>We have let them down.</strong></p><p>We’ve become a nation filled with schools that are underfunded and overcrowded, with broken facilities, and inadequate supplies. We are not giving the children of our nation the best education and care that we can.</p><p>The meager salaries we pay teachers only add to the dysfunction.  Teachers become tired and less focused when they are busy worrying about how to make ends meet, or working another job to do so on top of being a full-time teacher. All of this must stop.</p><p><strong>If we love our children, then our actions must show it.</strong></p><p>Thus, universal quality education for all of our children must start with pre-school and extend through higher education. It should be available to all of our people, in every neighborhood in America. That means free pre-school, and free public colleges, universities, and technical/trade schools. That means making big reforms to the student loan programs, payment plans and rates that we currently have while also putting in place legislation that protects our students from predatory, unconscionable and impractical student loan practices, plans and rates.</p><p>Roughly every 100 years, the United States expands its public education system to match its increasingly advanced economy. And now, it’s time to expand our national education system to include tuition-free public college and trade school. In fact, we’ve had this system before: The University of California system offered free tuition at its schools until the 1980s.</p><p>We need to honor our children and ensure a bright future for the generations after us.</p><p><strong>And the way to help our people and country thrive is by unleashing the creativity, power, potential and spirit of the American people, starting with those fresh out of school.</strong></p><p>At the end of WW2, the GI Bill helped build America’s great middle class – the same middle class that has been decimated by corporate-driven economics over the last forty years. A GI Bill level of investment in educating America’s youth would help bring the middle class back.</p><h3><strong>Why We Need It</strong></h3><p>Education is a form of empowerment, while under-education is a form of oppression. Our country is the only country that funds our public education through property taxes, ensuring that children from poorer neighborhoods receive a poorer education, thus deepening the roots of wealth inequality.</p><p>Many of our American children go to schools that lack the minimum supplies necessary to teach a child to read. A child who cannot read by the age of eight is less likely to graduate from high school and more likely to one day be incarcerated. This is more than an “educational issue”. It is a humanitarian crisis. In the richest country in the world.</p><p>The high cost of higher education is putting college out of the reach for many students unless their parents are wealthy. With a graduate leaving school anywhere from $10,000 – $250,000 in debt, our student loans now total over $1.5 trillion. And then on top of this, we let our government officials, like our current congressman pocket money from these student loan debt collectors? Isn’t this crazy? Why do we keep on electing officials who have no interest in investing in our children and future generations? It’s no wonder, then, that student loans are the only loans and form of debt that you cannot discharge when filing for bankruptcy in America – because politicians like our current Congressman take money from these corporate interests and are tainted. Our own politicians seem to support raising a generation of indentured servants who will spend decades – if not a lifetime – paying off banks, who then pay politicians like our current Congressman. I’m not lying.</p><h3><strong>What We Are Fighting For</strong></h3><p>In addition to fighting for free public school higher education for all (i.e., 2-yr, 4-yr, trade/vocational school), much can be done the area of student debt and finance reform, be it cancelling all current student debt on a one-time basis, extending federal student loan and tuition assistance programs to all forms of technical/trade school programs (i.e., coding bootcamp, music production, etc.), extending the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program to ALL students and graduates so that all of our students and graduates aren’t required to pay more than 10% of their annual income on student loans, and beyond 120 monthly payments, making student loans dischargeable, banning elected officials from pocketing money by student debt collectors and banks, or enacting legislation that restricts student loan companies and debt collectors from engaging in predatory practices. And I will make sure that we do not fall behind, and that no community is left behind because there isn’t equal access to good education.</p><p>In addition to major student funding and debt reform, we have the opportunity of really investing into our children and education system, where our children and all of us are actually learning, and not just memorizing and reciting back facts and pieces of information. I’ll push for legislation requiring a far more expansive array of educational approaches, including social and emotional learning; the development of conflict resolution skills; restorative justice (schools who implement such programs have seen up to a 65% reduction in violence and disorderly conduct); meditation and mindfulness; comparative religion (for the sake of spiritual enlightenment and to help ease religious strife); anti-bullying programs; and the fostering of other practical life skills to help prepare children for a meaningful life. We need a whole-person educational system that addresses the heart and soul as well as the intellect. And with this includes reforming out of control testing as we need to reduce the amount of high-stakes testing required and the associated value added model that unfairly associates teacher and school performance with the results of those high-stakes tests, and pushing for legislation that provides more teacher training programs and teacher retention, along with investing in teacher education programs that provide best practices and developmentally appropriate models of education for our future teachers, because by doing so, we give our teachers adequate preparation, support, leadership, autonomy, and compensation (pay) that reflects their professional stature – we need to ensure that teachers face classrooms of a manageable size – and that means hiring more teachers overall. Student/teacher ratios must shrink.</p><p>Universal pre-school must be provided to all children, while also ensuring that our children and students are able to pursue non-traditional opportunities in education as well, be it in the trades or technical areas. We must restrict the influence of corporate money on our education system, while also ensuring the safety of our children and students in school so they don’t have to worry about being in harm each day – and that means requiring very thorough background check and gun control and safety measures.</p><p>All of these things done together, with the focus really being on the overall health and well-being of our children and students, on all levels, including mental and emotional, is how we empower and unleash the spirit of our people and generations to come, to their full and greatest potential.</p><h3><strong>What It Will Do</strong></h3><p>Education is not only a gateway to a better job, but also to a more empowered life. Good universal education is essential to a democracy because it gives the tools to all citizens to think, and to act, with the power that is necessary for self-governance.</p><p>Without trained minds, we are less prepared for engaged citizenship. A more conscious sense of citizenship is imperative if we’re to right the ship of our democracy. Democracy bestows more than rights; it bestows responsibilities as well: the responsibility to understand what is happening to our country and communities from within, to make carefully considered decisions regarding who we elect to represent us. Education gives us a greater ability to direct our own lives, and a greater ability to direct the fate of our nation.</p><h2><strong>Social Security</strong></h2><p>First signed into law by President Franklin Roosevelt in 1935, Social Security was designed to ensure that America’s senior citizens could live honorably without fear of falling into poverty. During their peak years, workers pay into a fund and then receive fixed payments when they retire from the workforce. </p><h4><strong>Why We Need It</strong></h4><p>Since it offered security to people in their older years, the program was devised to provide exceptional security to society itself. Understanding that there is a fundamental floor of needs met for our people in later and less advantaged stages of life represents a benefit for all of us. </p><p>For generations, Social Security has functioned well to decrease poverty among our seniors and disabled Americans. Today, the program is under attack by big Wall Street banks and financial service organizations who seemingly have it in their sights simply to exploit a new and potentially massive source of income and bonuses. </p><h4><strong>What We Are Fighting For</strong></h4><p>Based on these attacks to the program, critics of Social Security claim that it will run out of money soon. While it must be said that there may be issues with funding in the future, the potential problems can be resolved with moderate changes. Simply increasing the cap on income which is subject to Social Security payroll tax, for instance, can help the system remain solvent permanently, without reducing benefits. </p><p>We should not put Social Security at risk under any circumstances. We must protect this fruitful and caring program which retiring Americans have counted on for almost eighty five years now.</p><p>To preserve Social Security and its massive societal benefits, we must: </p><ul><li>Combat any and all efforts to privatize Social Security</li><li>Support making needed changes to Social Security (like raising the cap on income subject to Social Security Payroll Taxes) that will simultaneously safeguard the rights of recipients while guaranteeing that the program doesn’t run out of money</li><li>Help start a much-needed national conversation about the best ways to go beyond Social Security and discover new paths to offer more holistic care for our expanding senior population</li></ul><h4><strong>What It Will Do</strong></h4><p>Preserving Social Security as a quintessential American program will provide enormous societal benefit as our population ages and grapples with economic instability caused by factors outside their control. Keeping it solvent will be vitally important to ensure that a basic floor of needs is met for a vulnerable population of our fellow citizens. We can ward off attacks to privatize Social Security while also pushing for needed reforms and discovering novel ways to take a more holistic approach to caring for our seniors. Together, we will make sure that America’s senior citizens are protected for generations to come.</p><h2><strong>Criminal Justice Overhaul</strong></h2><p>America, the land of the free, is home to 25% of the world’s incarcerated population. Our population makes up only 5% of the Earth’s total. These numbers are deeply tied to a national legacy of racism. Black Americans are incarcerated at five times the rate of white Americans. Black Americans are nearly four times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than white Americans, even though drug use rates remain consistent across races. Black Americans constitute two-thirds of the incarcerated population, with many living in solitary confinement and inhumane conditions while facing excessive sentencing. And for all the people we cage, 76% of prisoners are rearrested every five years. The failures of our criminal justice system destroy our communities.. It’s time we overhaul it.</p><h3><strong>Why We Need It</strong></h3><p>By allowing corporations to profit off the suffering of incarcerated people through the private prison industry, we’re enabling inhumane conditions to develop in our prisons, resulting in human rights violations, torture, and sexual assault. From lack of medical care to solitary confinement, we allow the private prison-industrial complex to seek profits over morals by advocating for longer sentences for people convicted of crimes. Government has turned a blind eye to these practices, all while allowing corporations, police departments, and cities to rake in billions in fines from our most vulnerable communities. With cash bail hurting lower-income communities and a plea bargaining system built to convict rather than find the truth, our criminal justice system hurts the vulnerable. We must take a stand and say no more. </p><h3><strong>What We Are Fighting For</strong></h3><p>We must (1) end profiteering in our criminal justice system by completely banning for-profit prisons and detention centers, and all other forms of profiteering in our criminal justice system; (2) end cash bail; (3) transform the way we police our communities (<em>see Restructuring American Policing)</em>; (4) allow everyone the right to counsel; (5) end mass incarceration and excessive sentencing (i.e., abolish death penalty; end mandatory sentencing minimums); (6) end the war on drugs (i.e., legalize marijuana and expunging past convictions) and stop criminalizing addiction by having health providers be first responders; (7) treat children like children (under 18) in the system and provide effective justice diversion programs, which hold youth accountable and give them tools to survive and thrive; (8) reform our prison system to make jails and prisons more humane; (9) guarantee a Prisoners Bill of Rights and ensure a just transition post-release; (10) end cycles of violence and provide support to survivors of crime; (11) prohibit profiling by law enforcement and intelligence agencies based on race, religion or national origin, by enacting the End Racial and Religious Profiling Act (H.R. 1498) [End Racial Profiling Act of 2019 (H.R. 4339)]; (12) promote educational, community restorative justice and employment programs that have been shown to improve community safety while creating opportunities for at-risk youth and adults, by re-allocating a portion of the funds annually given to state and local law enforcement agencies, and by tying federal grants to state adoption of statutes that redirect funds currently used for school police offers to restorative justice programs, trauma-informed counselors and student health centers; (13) provide incentives for states to offer after-school opportunities for young people, including safe places to be at night, as well as centers for sports, dance, art and cultural activities; (14) decriminalize drugs and treat drug addiction as a mental health and medical issue rather than a criminal issue; and (15) put an end to solitary confinement, which is a form of unconstitutional torture. </p><h3><strong>What It Will Do</strong></h3><p>By overhauling the criminal justice system, we’ll bring humanity back to law enforcement. When prisons are forced to focus on rehabilitation instead of profit, prisoners will be treated as people. Recognizing crime’s roots in deeper structural problems, we’ll save by not overspending in policing and prisons, and instead investing in solving joblessness, income inequality, lack of education, and untreated substance abuse. When people have jobs and money to buy food, sleep under a roof, can access free healthcare and a free education, and pay for basic expenses, crime will drop. Reforms that seek truth and humanity over arrests and convictions will level the playing field and empower communities to flourish.</p><h2><strong>Restructuring American Police</strong></h2><p>Black Americans are more likely <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/21/us/police-stops-race-stanford-study-trnd/index.html">to be stopped</a> by the police, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/08/us/us-police-floyd-protests-country-comparisons-intl/index.html">subjected to excessive force</a>, and <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3146057">arrested</a>. Black Americans are almost <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2016/12/20/health/black-men-killed-by-police/index.html">three times as likely</a> to be killed by police and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52877678">five times</a> as likely to be incarcerated as white Americans. Systemic racism, militarization of policing, and excessive force continue to pervade American law enforcement, despite recent efforts at reform. We need to employ mental health professionals and social workers in situations that have traditionally but incorrectly engaged police officers. We need to hold officers fully accountable for their actions, increase officer accountability, and prohibit the equipment and tactics that enable excessive use of force. We need to reimagine the role of law enforcement to genuinely serve and protect our communities.</p><h3><strong>Why We Need It</strong></h3><p>Law enforcement in the South began as slave patrol, with teams of vigilantes hired to recapture escaped slaves. Then, when slavery was abolished, the police harshly enforced Jim Crow laws. Aggressive policing practices including racial profiling, stop and frisk, broken-windows policing, police brutality, and the war on drugs—waged almost exclusively in communities of color—threaten American livelihood. By jailing and targeting our most vulnerable communities, we aren’t making them safer. We’re making them more violent and unstable. A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0211-5">2017 report</a> showed that when the NYPD purposely pulled back on “proactive policing”, it received 2,100 fewer crime complaints over just several weeks. We police and punish people for poverty and social disorganization instead of caring for communities and eradicating underlying conditions. Poverty is the cause of crime, not the result of it. We must stop shifting the burden of responsibility for declining living conditions onto marginalized communities and stop purporting that the solution to all social ills is more aggressive policing. It’s not working.</p><p>Throughout the past decade, we’ve implemented more training for police, along with body cameras, diversity initiatives, and community policing. We now know that these steps were merely cosmetic changes. It’s discouraging to see city governments, like ours in <a href="https://deadline.com/2020/06/lapd-funding-city-council-reduce-operating-budget-1202950507/">Los Angeles</a>, spend a majority of their budget on policing the people, instead of caring for them, when we know over-policing doesn’t work. Real progress requires deeper change.</p><h3><strong>What We’re Fighting For</strong></h3><p>Our economy is being devastated by income inequality, automation, and COVID. Studies show that the desperation caused by <a href="https://journalistsresource.org/studies/government/criminal-justice/unemployment-property-crime-burglary/">poverty and unemployment can be driving factors for crime</a>. Instead of watching our communities crumble and locking up our neighbors on the way down, let’s ensure that our communities are cared for by investing more in jobs, healthcare coverage, mental health support, housing, food, hospitals, schools and other important community resources and services.</p><p>We’ll work to shift federal funding of local police to employ mental health providers, social workers, victim advocates, and community members as emergency responders, replacing the need for a militarized police presence in cities across America. We’ll gradually reappropriate funds from military equipment for police, which will reduce law enforcement’s access to resources that put our communities in danger. We will reinvest that money back into our communities, to fund schools, hospitals, housing, and food, all of which will reduce the underlying causes of crime.</p><p>We’ll fight to:</p><ul><li>Demilitarize police by restricting military gear in our communities to police that are required to use it, such as SWAT team members. Those officers should also be held to the same standards as members of the military.</li><li>Encourage independent civilian oversight boards equipped with the power to issue administrative subpoenas and impose penalties for police misconduct.</li><li>Prohibit profiling by law enforcement and intelligence agencies based on race, religion or national origin, by enacting the End Racial and Religious Profiling Act (H.R. 1498).</li><li>Ensure accountability and fairness in prosecution by ending qualified immunity for officers and government officials and holding them fully accountable for their actions.</li><li>Ban no-knock raids.</li><li>Establish a national domestic violence registry with a heightened class of offenders, consisting of domestically violent armed officers, along with other policy measures.</li><li>Call for more Department of Justice investigations of police departments, as departments that receive federal intervention have 25-30% fewer police shootings than those that do not.</li><li>Ban the use of “resisting arrest” as a sole justification for arrest.</li><li>Require police officers to maintain personal insurance policies to pay out settlements. This will remove taxpayer burden and also ensure that a police officer with excessive liabilities will be removed by the market</li><li>Remand the pensions and ban from working those officers convicted in excessive force cases</li><li>Cap overtime pay for military exercises</li><li>Reduce the size of the police force</li><li>Abolish civil asset forfeiture, which is routinely used to arbitrarily separate citizens from property without regard for due process.</li></ul><h3><strong>What It Will Do</strong></h3><p>With over <a href="https://www.prisonpolicy.org/blog/2020/06/05/policekillings/">1,000 Americans killed</a> by police every year, and Black Americans disproportionately affected, it is our duty to put better policies in place. Devoting resources to mental health and social worker first responders, demilitarizing police forces, and gradually reappropriating police funds towards community investment will enable appropriate, peaceable responses to all emergency situations. And by ensuring officers who breach protocol are held fully accountable by external agencies and not above the law, we’ll establish law enforcement that truly serves and protects the people. By recognizing the truth⁠⁠⁠, that American Police originated as a racist institution, and by pushing for systemic change to erase that legacy, we will create a safer and more equitable
