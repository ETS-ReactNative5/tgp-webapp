We need to work together to fix the Affordable Care Act (ACA), not dismantle it. In Congress, I will work to make healthcare more affordable for working families. I’ll also work to end the medical device tax and ensure that workers in collective bargaining agreements aren’t subject to the so-called Cadillac tax.</p><p>This should be something we all agree on, but instead of working toward this goal, Republicans in Washington have focused on dismantling the Affordable Care Act. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the recent tax legislation would result in 13 million fewer people having health insurance.</p><p>We should implement a public option for the ACA so that the insurance companies that are acting as a near monopoly in some places have competition. I also support allowing people aged 55-65, who face the highest prices under the current system, to buy into Medicare.</p><p>Lastly, I believe no one should face bankruptcy from healthcare costs. We must ensure that there is healthcare for all through an efficient and patient-friendly system.</p><p><b>Growing a New Economy</b><br></p><p>Now is the time for us to value hard work, prioritize wage growth and support working families. I have spent my career working alongside Midwest manufacturing companies large and small. We must get serious about the cost of living and earnings. I support increasing the minimum wage and encouraging larger businesses to support the $15 minimum wage. In an age when corporate executives make up to 300 times more than the average worker, we need to encourage wage growth through equal access to opportunity, where every child can live up to their full potential to succeed.</p><p>We need to reorient our policies so that people, not corporations, are at the forefront. Public private partnerships are critical to growing our economy and are something I believe in, having spent a career working at the intersection of industry and government.</p><p>I was at the table when the Economic Development Administration invested in the Detroit Regional Chamber to create a supplier diversification program. I have managed and created job training programs focused on advanced manufacturing and believe Michigan’s future of automation and innovation will continue to unlock incredible job opportunities, as long as we have policy makers advocating for the value of technical talent and hard work.</p><p>Manufacturing is the backbone of the economy in Southeast Michigan, and I am running as a woman in manufacturing with the economic development experience that will bring industry and government leaders together to produce outcomes for our district.</p><p>I support collective bargaining rights and value the service labor unions provide to our workers. I am a staunch supporter of the Davis-Bacon Act (1931) that established a prevailing wage for public works, and I have been an outspoken critic of Lansing’s attempt to repeal Michigan’s prevailing wage law on the state level.</p><p>We must address the Michigan teacher shortage by investing in public education at pre-K through grade 12. Public education dollars must be fully allocated, and our educators should receive the respect and dignity they deserve. We can address income disparities by providing access to affordable higher education for all. The average student loan debt in Michigan is nearly $30,000 and I will take on predatory lenders and corrupt, for-profit institutions of higher education. We need to protect interest rates, support our borrowers with fair repayment options and make secondary education accessible. That means free community college options and fair costs for in-state schools.</p><p>For the burgeoning and existing workforce, I believe in a 21st century labor movement that protects workers, supports training programs, and pays a livable wage. We need a federal government that strategically invests in research and development that supports the great innovation taking place in southeastern Michigan. My background has been tied to innovation programs and job creation efforts, and that is where I will be focused in Congress.</p><p>We need to support trade deals that prioritize the American worker and keep profits within our borders, while also holding China accountable. I would like to see a negotiation of trade agreements to level the playing field of wages and with new leadership, we can get these deals done.</p><p>Finally, I believe we must once and for all end the gender pay gap and support paid family leave for all Americans.</p><p><b>Quality Education for Students</b><br></p><p>As the daughter of a retired Detroit public school teacher, I am a fierce advocate for Michigan’s public education system. I am very troubled by the directives coming out of Betsy DeVos’ Department of Education. From pre-K to higher education, we need a member of Congress who will fight back against the Trump-DeVos education agenda and advocate for Michigan’s educators, students, and families.</p><p>There are currently no Michigan Democrats sitting on the U.S. House Committee on Education and the Workforce. When I am elected, I will seek out a spot on that committee to be the voice that Michigan families deserve.</p><p>At the K-12 level, the federal government’s role is to ensure that the neediest students succeed and to work as a partner with state and local governments. The federal government has a legal obligation to ensure equal access to education through Title 1. Unfortunately, the level of support provided is frequently far below the level needed to actually ensure equality, and in Congress I will support additional funding to help close the achievement gap.</p><p>I have a background in workforce development and have developed STEM education programs for middle school and high school students in digital manufacturing and software engineering. I am a strong proponent of apprenticeship and vocational education. We need to support Michigan schools to advance and increase our technical workforce and get back to the hands-on learning that our schools excelled in for many years.</p><p>I support proposals to make community college tuition-free through state based cost-sharing programs. I support using such programmatic dollars to increase the size of Pell Grants and make four-year college degrees significantly less costly. Finally, I stand by union run apprenticeship programs that link community colleges with employers and support employers who are directly looking to offer apprenticeship programs.</p><p>I am proud to have led workforce development initiatives with SkillsUSA, National Institute of Metalworking Skills, SME, ASME, the Manufacturing Institute, Code for America, the Department of Defense and the Department of Labor throughout my career. I have managed a multi-million dollar federally funded job training portfolio that received matching corporate investment and buy-in from universities, community colleges, and high schools.</p><p>For students who choose to attend 4-year universities, the cost of higher education is out of control. Over 44 million Americans owe a combined $1.4 trillion in student debt. That is more than than two and a half times what they owed just a decade ago. The average student in Michigan graduates with over $30,000 in student loan debt. This burden of debt is unacceptable, and the hefty price tag of higher education makes college seem out of reach for too many Michiganders. We must also address predatory lending and some for-profit colleges who subject student borrowers to extreme costs without a return on a certified degree.</p><p>In Congress, I will fight for every Michigan student — whether they are 3 or 73. Education holds the key to opportunity, and we must make sure every individual has the means to pull themselves up by their bootstraps by pursuing an educational track that will allow them to achieve the American Dream.</p><p><b>Our Promise to Seniors</b><br></p><p>In Congress, I will fight any attempt to privatize social security or turn Medicare into a voucher program.</p><p>These are programs that seniors paid into their entire working lives, and we must keep our promise to them by ensuring these programs are protected now and for generations to come. During the 2016 campaign, President Trump vowed to protect Social Security and Medicare. You can be sure I won’t let him forget it.</p><p>We must also ensure our seniors receive access to long-term care options, affordable housing options and have advocates in Congress to protect them from predatory and fraudulent schemes.</p><p>Finally, prescription drug costs are through the roof. Our senior citizens should never have to choose between paying for food or paying for their prescriptions.</p><p><b>Protecting Our “Pure Michigan” Environment</b><br></p><p>I believe climate change is a serious problem and needs to be addressed immediately before it is too late. When an overwhelming number of scientists around the world have cited the realities and dangerous implications of climate change, this is not a partisan issue, but the global challenge of our generation that requires dedicated leadership to tackle. President Trump has frequently and recklessly referred to climate change as a “hoax” and his Administration has continued to degrade the environment and puts us at risk to the worst threats of climate change.</p><p>Climate change and environmental degradation are issues that affect our entire planet, meaning we need an international solution supported by countries across the globe. President Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement was extremely misguided and is a move I strongly oppose. Additionally, we need to stop the regressive politics of undermining the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and keystone policies that protect our air, water, and natural resources. We only have one planet, and it is important that we protect it for future generations. We must fight to keep Michigan the “Pure Michigan” that we love. We must protect our Great Lakes with the proper funding and scientific resources.</p><p>I believe the United States can lead the way in promoting a clean energy future. Through my work on the U.S. Auto Rescue, I established a track record of working on behalf of policies that cracked down on harmful emissions. Under the Cash for Clunkers program as part of the U.S. Auto Rescue efforts, consumers were encouraged to trade in vehicles with fuel economy of 18 miles per gallon or fewer in exchange for refund vouchers worth $3,500 to $4,500. The goal was to remove the more polluting vehicles from the road and spur economic growth. I have worked with manufacturers to support investments in clean and renewable energy through now-expired tax incentive programs that encouraged sustainable energy investment. There is no country or workforce more resilient or innovative than that of the United States of America, and we will lead the charge in growing and revitalizing our economy while pushing for technologies that will continue to improve the quality of our environment and reduce the catastrophic effects of climate change.</p><p><b>A Plan for Immigration</b><br></p><p>The metro Detroit region shows the way forward on immigration. We have a community of people with roots from all over the world working together.</p><p>The Trump administration’s divisive response to immigration issues is appalling and harmful. We must never forget that America is a country of immigrants. Recent actions by the Trump administration and Congress violate not only individual liberties, but also undermine our system of federalism and principles of local control. We need to curb the overreaching power of ICE.</p><p>Congress needs to pass legislation on comprehensive immigration that treats people with dignity. We need to pass legislation that supports deferred action for childhood arrivals known as DACA and grants citizenship. Now is the time for Congress to come together and fix a broken immigration system that has resulted in painful separations, impacted families and communities, and hurt our economy. It is no doubt that America, a nation of proud immigrants, needs to embrace safe, legal, and fair immigration policies and enforce the laws humanely.</p><p><b>Advocating for Equality</b><br></p><p>I am a lifelong friend of the LGBTQ+ community and believe LGBTQ+ individuals should have the same rights as all other Americans. In recent years, we have witnessed progress when it comes to LGBTQ+ rights, much of which has come from court decisions such as the now famous Supreme Court case that legalized gay marriage. We still have work to do in Michigan. For instance, Michigan state law does not include full protections for people based on their sexual orientation or gender identity. This means it is still legal to deny employment, housing, and medical treatment based on gender identity or sexual orientation. It is important that we have strong partnerships and support for LGBTQ+ rights and that current progress at the federal level is not undone. In Congress, I will support the LGBTQ+ community and be a voice for equality under the law.</p><p><b>Commonsense Gun Laws</b><br></p><p>It is past time that we act on commonsense gun reform. On January 3, 2019, I will send a Dear Colleague letter to the new class of the 116th United States Congress outlining my plan to begin an immediate dialogue on addressing gun violence in America.</p><p>With every passing day the urgency grows stronger, but still we are met with resistance and inaction from those who currently represent us. The overwhelming urgency of now is upon is.</p><p>We must end loopholes in the background checks system, finally pass a bill to crack down on bump stocks, and preserve current protections against gun silencers. These are commonsense reforms that cannot wait, and they will get my attention on day one in office.</p><p><b>Veterans and Defense</b><br></p><p>The mission of the Department of Veterans Affairs is to fulfill President Lincoln’s promise “to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan.” Having learned from family members who served in the military and in combat zones, I understand the special role that veterans play in our society. I have developed workforce training programs and have spent time on military bases to development training programs for service members.</p><p>The Department of Energy’s Advanced Manufacturing Office funded an exciting Advanced Manufacturing Internship program, which is designed to provide accelerated, hands-on career training for veterans and next-generation engineers to prepare them for long term manufacturing jobs upon leaving service.</p><p>We must continue to support veterans who return from service with visible and unseen scars. While the Department of Veterans Affairs maintains a National Resource Directory to help veterans and wounded warrior access programs and services, we must ensure that the VA is adequately serving our veterans. We need a VA that addresses mental health and suicide prevent and an agency that is equipped with the staff and resources to deliver for our ventures, particularly much needed medical staff.</p><p>I believe in the role the Department of the Defense plays in our government. I have worked closely with the DOD throughout my career, particularly the Office of Manufacturing and Industrial Based Policy. The DOD can be a partner for metro-department automakers and suppliers as our industrial base has been critical to our long term national security. We need to encourage public private partnerships and co-investment in R&D, Innovation and supply chain securitization, particularly for cyber security. We do not need to bloat the DOD budget at the expense of domestic programs. I believe in responsible spending that equips our soldiers and military personnel with the resources they need to do their jobs.</p><p>The United States foreign policy success rests squarely with strategic allied relationships, the utilization of smart power and diplomacy. We must avoid isolationist policies that fray international relationships and continue to develop strong bonds with our allies.</p><p>I believe in a strong U.S.-Israel relationship. The United States and Israel maintain a special allied relationship, bound by our shared commitment to common values. This is a relationship that must continue to thrive and go unquestioned – and most importantly cannot become a partisan issue. I am undoubtedly a staunch supporter of Israel and am eager for the opportunity to experience the country first-hand. I believe that the U.S-Israel relationship maintains security in an unstable part of the world, and that our country will continue to support Israel’s democratically elected leaders to further the mutual goals and necessary interests shared between our countries.</p><p>Both countries have a shared opportunity and a lot to gain from working together. I believe the past has shown us the results of a strong, allied relationship and that will benefit generations to follow. We set a global precedent and strengthen against threats and secure a mutual interest in a vulnerable region through a strong U.S-Israel partnership.</p><p><b>A Voice for Women</b><br></p><p>When I am elected to Congress, I will be the first woman to ever represent Michigan’s 11th District. I will use my office to defend women’s rights and champion the cause of full equality for women under the law.</p><p>We must end the gender pay gap. Nationally, women are paid 80 cents for every $1 a man is paid. In Michigan, women make only 78 cents to every $1 for men. The numbers are even worse for women of color. According to a National Partnership for Women & Families study, black women in Michigan make 63 cents for every $1 a man is paid, and Latina women make only 58 cents. This is unacceptable. In Congress, I will be a strong advocate for equal pay for women.</p><p>I am also an ardent supporter of paid family leave. In an economic environment where it can be difficult to make ends meet even as a middle class family, allowing parents with newborns and individuals with ailing family members to have some time off work to take care of their loved ones could not be more important. Congress must act on passing legislation that puts American families first by guaranteeing paid family leave.</p><p>Finally, I support a woman’s right to choose and I do not think federal lawmakers should be injecting themselves into women’s reproductive matters. I will fight for women’s reproductive freedom and will oppose the Trump Administration’s attempts to defund Planned Parenthood and deny women insurance for birth control. These attacks on women’s rights must stop.</p><p><b>Addiction and Drug Policy</b><br></p><p>The nationwide addiction crisis is something we as a country must come together to address immediately. Our families and communities are being torn apart by opioid abuse, and our government has a duty to take action to combat this epidemic. I support legislation that investigates inappropriate prescribing of narcotics, emphasizes treatment over prosecution, and gives Americans over-the-counter access to the lifesaving medication naloxone.</p><p>Another approach we must take to curb opioid addiction is decriminalizing marijuana for medicinal and recreational use. Studies have shown that full, federal legalization of medical marijuana in particular could be an effective solution to combat opioid addiction.</p><p>In addition to legalizing marijuana for medicinal purposes, I support descheduling marijuana from the Controlled Substances Act and pardoning and wiping the records of past offenders who were convicted of non-violent, marijuana-related crimes. We should begin taxing and regulating marijuana to fund important projects like our roads and our schools.</p><p>Finally, we must end the War on Drugs as we know it. Drug policy and prosecution targets people of color at a disproportionate rate. This form of injustice and inequality is unacceptable and it is not effectively solving the problem of ridding our communities of drugs and crime. We must reexamine how we approach drug policy with the purpose of supporting American families. I believe that together we can come up with solutions to save lives and rebuild the communities that have suffered from addiction for far too long.</p><p><b>Standing Up to Donald Trump</b><br></p><p>Now is the time for bold and courageous leadership. We must hold Donald Trump accountable for his lack of decency, corruption, open bigotry and attack on basic facts and science. I fully intend to stand up to the Trump Administration. I marched for Science in Detroit, I stood up to the racist and hateful crimes in Charlottesville, Virginia, and I got on the phone with community leaders when wrongful deportations were threatened against long standing residents of our district. I am here for decency, listening, and collaboration. I know we might not always agree. We must return to collaborative government and getting things done for the American people.</p><p><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-quotedisclaimer_7-0"><a
